<poem>
A twinkling in the river. Then a sudden turn and I can see silveryscales. At the same time, the bobber that has been sitting patiently suddenly catches and dips into the water.  

【Rick】 "Alright! Got it!" 

I carefully time it and pull the rod up.  

The trees in the forest shake and rustle. I heave and send the fish flying out of the river, the splash getting water on my whiskers. 

I take the cover off the fish basket that's floating in the water, and pull the hook  out of the fish I just caught.  

【Rick】 "Ah-, Aah!"

The fish slips through my hands and falls back into the river with a splash,disappearing  from my sight.

The noise of the water and the cry of the cicadas are all I'm left with.  

I wipe off my wet whiskers. 

【Rick】 "... oh well." 

In the fish basket are more than enough fish to make dinner for me and my littlebrother.

I pull the basket out of the water. Cold water drips off it and leaves wetmarks on the ground.  

I moan as I stretch my back and take adeep breath, filling my lungs with thesmell of the water and flowers. 

This riverside is far away from Bastokvillage.  

On a huge island afloat in the middle ofthe river bloom the fragrant flowers knownas Amorea.  

This has become my favorite fishing spot, I can easily catch a side dish for dinner here. Since it's so far away from the village nobody ever comes here, so it feels like my own private spot. 

I wind up the fishing rod and lift thebasket on my shoulder.

With the setting sun at my back, I head home. 

From the top of the hill I can see theedge of the continent. As always, all you can see below is the everflowing stream ofpure white clouds.  

The smell of the wind that brushes againstmy fur is different here than the forest. Perhaps it's the smell of those clouds. 

"What if I could cross this edge, whatwould lie beyond those clouds?", I wonder.  

Spreading out beyond them lies a newworld that I have yet to see. I don't knowwhether or not that world really exists,but I feel it definitely does.

In the holy scripture it says that belowthe continent there's nothing but thick lavaand darkness, and that the continent we liveon was born from that darkness. 

I don't believe in that nonsense. 

Our father was a scholar. He studiedancient documents and myths. And he found out that another world exists below those clouds. 

Below this continent, a civilization is flourishing, a whole different world exists there. That's what he wrote in his diaryand his research papers.

I don't really have any memories of myfather. All I know is what my mother told me. 

She said that in order to go to the out-side world, father engaged in forbidden research about aircraft.  

Because of that, because he had committed heresy, he was arrested by the Holy Order's military police and executed. That's what mother said.  

But that isn't true.I've found father's secret study. Left therewere records about the completion of hisairplane, dated until the day before hisflight. 

Dad being arrested by the order, that was all a lie.Dad flew his airplane to that other world.

The Order probably wanted to cover up thatthe forbidden airplane really flew throughthe sky.

I too want to fly through the sky, just like my father. And I want to make sure with my own eyes what kind of world iswaiting for me out there. 

Luckily dad left an unfinished airplane together with the blueprints in his study.I can only take one step at a time, but I will continue building it.

One day I will feel my body shake as Ihead for the end of the clouds. 

The drifting clouds are starting to get tinged with a faint orange. The cry of thecicadas has changed and an evening breeze has started to blow.

I realize that I must be making mybrother wait for dinner, so I hurry down  that hill and back home.

・・・・

【Napp】 "Hey, welcome back big brother." 

【Rick】 "I'm home. Anything happened?" 

【Napp】 "Nah, all the same." 

【Rick】 "I see. Alright, just wait a minute, I'll  start making dinner right away."

My little brother Napp nods lightly and continues to read his book. 

Napp is suffering from an illness.Because he has been ill ever since he was a child, he never got out of the house much.

It's like he has a weak heart, and as longas he lies down there really is no problemat all, but having to spend most of the timelaying in bed, I really can't take seeing him like this.  

Today's dinner is a hot egg soup with lotsof milk in it, salt-fried fish stuffed with aromatic herbs, and nuts bread. 

Since we both love egg soup with milk weshare a pot of it and end up making quite a mess. 

After resting a bit Napp returns to his room, and I think: Why not tag along to chat with him for a while?

【Rick】 "You know, the last fish that I let free was the biggest I caught today."

While saying that I point out with both of my index fingers how big that fish was.

【Napp】 "Hahaha, wasn't it more like the size of the ones we had for dinner? You're  exaggerating big brother."  

【Rick】 "Come on, how could you know without seeing."

【Napp】 "Because you said you let the big one free." 

Napp says, giggling afterwards. 

【Rick】 "Earlier I found a new document in dad's study, did I tell you about that?"

【Napp】 "I don't think you have, but I'm not really  interested in that anyway." 

【Rick】 "Always the same old story." 

【Napp】 "That's my line big brother, you are the one that talks about nothing but that silly stuff." 

【Rick】 "Is that so? Are you really not interested in that? Whether there's a new world  beyond those clouds?" 

【Napp】 "Wanting to go beyond the clouds is already  a disgraceful thought! What right do we have to intrude into the sky?"  

【Rick】 "That's just what that monk used to tell us  long ago. You have to see that with the eyes of a scientist." 

【Napp】 "That's not the only reason! Wasn't it because dad went to the other world that  mom has had such a hard time?"

【Rick】 "But, dad flew with an airplane, beyond  the clouds. That's amazing, isn't it?"

【Napp】 "That's all you see in him big brother! I  will never forgive him. 

I know what he did was amazing. But, wasn't it his fault that our mother  died? 

Was it not father's fault that we had to  suffer that much?"  

【Rick】 "That may be true, but-" 

【Napp】 "I cannot forgive him! And also, aren't  aircraft banned by the Holy Order?

We don't even know if he made it over to  the other side safely, and it's the same  with you, you too can't say for sure if you can make it there.

It's just as possible that you'll be  arrested and punished." 

【Rick】 "Hahaha, now you're the one that's exaggerating, Napp."

【Napp】 "No I'm not! I'm worried about you brother..." 

【Rick】 "I know I know. Still, my dream remains  unchanged. I will travel to the outside world, just like our father." 

【Napp】 "I wonder how often we've fought about this..."

【Rick】 "Well, by the way, this year is the year of the Stormrise. That will be my chance."

【Napp】 "That's right, but still...... No, enough of that. Now that you've come  this far, there's no way you'd listen to  me, right big brother?" 

He giggles after saying that. 

【Rick】 "Well, I'll finish my milk then and go to  bed." 

【Napp】 "Uh huh, good night."

【Rick】 "It's late so don't keep reading those books for too long, ok?"  

【Napp】 "Sure thing."

After I leave Napp's room, I go to theliving room to pour some cinnamon syrup into my hot milk, then I gulp it down, go back to my room and dive into bed.

As I curl up under the blanket, for somereason I'm getting the feeling that I willhave a good dream tonight. I smirk and laugh. 

・・・・

I'm on my way back from catching fish asusual.  

I got a couple of really big ones today,so as I approach the hill I wonder if I should dry them in the sun. 

【？？？】 "Yo, Rick. How's it going?"

I hear a voice from somewhere, I know thatvoice. How long has it been? A voice that I used to hear a lot as a child, it came from behind me.  

【Rick】 "Eeh!? Zail!"

【Zail】 "Fit as a fiddle, I see."  

【Rick】 "Sure am. What are you doing here? Jeez it's been ages." 

【Zail】 "I just kind of felt like seeing Bastok  again after being gone for so long."

Zail is a few years older than me; when wewere little he was somewhat like my big brother. Even though he was born into a wealthy family he hung out with poor kids like me, as if it didn't matter.  

When he grew up he moved to Midel so he could attend the academy, and we really couldn't see each other that much anymore.  

I haven't thought about him much lately,since he left Midel to live in the capital. 

The Zail that is standing in front of menow is a completely different person from the boy I knew back then, but when I see hisface and hear his voice now it's like the many years that we haven't seen each otherare erased in an instant. 

【Rick】 "Those clothes...  You're an officer of the Holy Order?" 

【Zail】 "Yeah. After finishing the academy in  Midel, I went for the entrance exam.  From now on I am a member of the branch in  Midel." 

【Rick】 "Wow.  But I heard the officer exam of the Order is really tough." 

【Zail】 "Hahaha. Well, it was a real pain. But thanks to that I can finally protect  the peace in our homeland." 

Bastok and Zapat, with Midel in the centerform the greater Midel area.To protect Midel also means protecting  Bastok. 

Zail, with his strong sense of justice andhis keen mind, is perfect for that job in myopinion.

【Zail】 "It's so beautiful, isn't it?  The scenery hasn't changed one bit since  I was a child." 

【Rick】 "Yeah, you're right. From here you got a great view on the outside of our continent."

【Zail】 "Rick, do you mean to tell me that you still want to go to the outside world?" 

【Rick】 "Eh? Of course I do! It's my dream after all." 

Long ago, while playing with Zail, we stood at this place and spoke about the outside world.

Even before I found out what father was actually doing, I have always had aninterest in that world. It's in our blood I guess.

【Zail】 "Having an interest in the outside world implies the wish to break into the sky. That is blasphemy! Flying through the gracious sky is a disgraceful wish that we  should not even think about!" 

What he's saying now is the same as backthen. Zail is deeply religious and used towarn me like that even when we were still kids. 

【Rick】 "I am grateful to the sky, but you see,  this and that are two different things. In my dreams I see the place beyond those clouds."

【Zail】 "I knew it, you're still saying the same things you did as a child." 

He rubs the underside of his nose and laughs lightly. 

【Zail】 "Well, I think that way of thinking is what  makes mankind advance.  No matter what I think about it,  I do understand how you feel."

He used to say "Sorry", close his mouth bitterly and continue his preaching.It seems like he really has changed since back then.

【Zail】 "But, I just don't want to see you go down the same road your father did." 

【Rick】 "My father?" 

【Zail】 "He studied the outside world and was  arrested and punished by the Holy Order.  You know that, don't you?"  

【Rick】 "Yeah, I sure know that."

It seems like Zail only knows what theOrder told him. 

【Zail】 "As you can see I am now an officer of the Holy Order. I don't want to have to arrest  you." 

【Rick】 "Can't you just look away then?  I'm just one person, who's gonna find out?" 

I laugh as I say that.  

【Zail】 "What kind of an officer would that make me? Of course I can't do that!" 

For an instant, I can see a sparkling inhis eyes. 

【Rick】 "But still, even if you catch me, I'll..." 

【Zail】 "Stop, don't speak any further.  If I were to hear anymore I would have to arrest you right here." 

He holds his index finger in front of mymouth, so I shut up.

【Zail】 "I'll be in Bastok today and tomorrow. I live in Midel, on 5th Street now. Come  around and show your face from time to  time, ok? I know a great place there."

He takes his finger away as he says that. 

【Rick】 "Ah, alright. I'll show up when I visit  Midel, I promise!"

We say goodbye and head back to our homes.

・・・・

To the west of Midel lies a mountain wherecoal is mined, allowing the town to prosper.

Many young folk from Bastok also work inthe mines.

When I went shopping in Midel I bumpedinto a couple of friends that came home from work and was dragged along into atavern. 

I'm not really a big drinker, but thatdoesn't mean I don't like having a drink. 

And I hope that they serve lots of grilledstockfish there.

【Tiegel】 "Today everything's on me. Drink as much as you want!" 

【Rick】 "Why so generous today?" 

【Mag 】 "We found a really big coal vein, you know.  Got a special bonus for that."

【Tiegel】 "Yeah! Isn't that great? How long do you want to keep wasting your time as a fisherman?  You should join us in the mines and make  some real money!" 

【Rick】 "It's alright, fishing may not pay well, but I'm the type of guy that enjoys living  this way, I'm happy the way it is." 

Honestly, manual work just doesn't suit me. Not that mental work really suits meeither; I'm not smart like my little brotherNapp, 

but I still enjoy the way my life is rightnow and I'm happy.

Living in Bastok you don't really needmoney that badly. Food, a roof over yourhead, you get all that from nature there. 

Shortly after, the booze we ordered arrives and things are turning into a drinking bout.

In this bar the waitresses are all cute girls, with thin tails wrapped around their hips. 

While putting the steins down on the tablethe soft hairtuft on the girl's breasts waves right in front of our noses 

and Tiegel whistles lewdly. 

The girls here are used to it and she answers with a light wink.

Since I haven't eaten anything fancy in a while, I'm ordering my favorite dish: Fried fish, pickled vegetables, fresh potatoes and a fried mincemeat roll with soysauce, as well as a trout pot pie.

【Mag 】 "Aaah-! That's good! A big mug of beer after work is the greatest thing after all!"

Mag empties the whole stein in one go and wipes the foam away.

【Rick】 "Whew, a good beer like that really makes  you feel alive, right?" 

【Tiegel】 "You bet! And that's why you can't just  stop after one beer. C'mon Rick, have another one. Hey lil' sweetie, another  round for me and my friend here!" 

With these words Tiegel orders another mugof beer for me without waiting for my answer. 

The two of us, our faces red from all the beer, are gulping down one mug after theother without end.

Even our fluffy tails are hanging downlazily. 

【？？？】 "We sure are in a good mood, aren't we?" 

We hear a voice say.

【Tiegel】 "Hm? Ya want something?" 

Tiegel answers flippantly and laughs as helooks over to the stranger. 

A pair of guys is standing in front of ourtable, laughing as they look down on us three.

【？？？】 "Nyahaha. Oh, nothing! I just couldn't help  but notice that awful stench of yours." 

【Tiegel】 "What!?" 

He barks at the two and stands up from hisseat. 

【？？？】 "It's the stench of a guy from Bastok."

The two start to laugh in a sinister way. 

【Mag 】 "Well look whose here, some striped tails."

The two have a striped pattern at the tip of their tails. They are from Zapat.

Zapat is a village in the fork of a big river, just on the other side of Bastok.

For ages there has been a feud betweenBastok and Zapat, there have been confron-tations at every opportunity, the fightinggoes on and on. 

The reason for that feud has long beenforgotten by the citizens of both villages, nobody really knows why they never get along. 

Whatever it was, I'm sure it was a stupid reason to begin with. 

The Holy Order tore down the bridge connecting the two cities, because of the on-going quarrels, a few years after I wasborn. 

The citizens of both villages each have tails with special traits.People from Bastok have tails that are allfluffy at the end. Those from Zapat have astripe pattern on theirs. 

That's why we derisively call the villagers of Zapat "striped tails". 

People from Zapat in return got a nickname for us too, "fluffy tails", and nothingpisses us off more than that awfully cute name. 

【Stiped Tail 1 】 "Are those fluffy tails in fashion now? Aw,  aren't you the cutest." 

【Tiegel】 "You bastard-!"  

He yanks the striped tail. And it goeswithout saying that he gets his yanked back.

Tiegel beats his opponent to the ground.

The surprised look in the striped tail'sface turns into a sharp one,

a vein pops up in his face and he sends Tiegel flying.

【Mag 】 "Now you're gonna get it too-!"

Mag grabs the other striped tail andstarts beating him up.

【Striped Tail 2】 "Guh-!"

I just idly look on.

I'm not in the mood for a fight.

While I'm not exactly strong, I also seehow pointless these fights with the striped tails are.

With the stein in one hand, I continuewatching the fight. 

【Rick】 "Leave me out of this."

I don't know if anyone can hear me but I'msaying it anyway and try to act like an innocent bystander. 

In front of my eyes my two friends andthose striped tails are beating each otherup. 

【Striped Tail 1】 "Guah-...!"

Tiegel's claws rip the face of the stripedtail apart. 

We are no idiots, it's common sense that theclaws and fangs of us guys from Bastok arestrong enough to kill anybody that provokes us. 

That's why we don't bite or scratch anybody thoughtlessly.

【Tiegel】 "... Nh- you bastard!" 

Nonetheless, the fact that even a guy likeTiegel got his claws out right away shows how much the striped tail are pissing us off. 

【Mag 】 "-Aah!"

The other striped tail has bitten Mag inhis shoulder. 

From the beginning it was clear that this wasn't a fight either side would allowthemselves to lose. 

... a fight without reason. 

Neither of them knowing why.

It's just that they can't stand each other, it's just that they live in Bastok andthe others in Zapat.

It all comes down to hate.It's the only reason they're fighting.

Even if winning that fight won't change a damn thing. 

There's no way that this hate could havealways been there, and that's why winning won't change anything.

As usual some of that hate would remain.

The two villages hate each other. Theyhate the fluffy tail or the striped one. Andfueled by that, the hatred lives on day after day.

... it's so ridiculous. 

What if...

What if I could go beyond those clouds, how would that world be, I wonder.

If it's possible, I wish for it to be a world without pointless fighting. 

I hope that it's a world where people can always work happily together, 

where they can share tasty meals with eachother and were they can spend their dayssurrounded by their family and loved ones.

And even if all of that can't be true inthat place, I still hope for it to be a better world. 

【Tiegel】 "Rick! Come here and help us!" 

He is staring at me and grinding his teeth. 

While I had been watching the fight someother striped tails came to help the firsttwo.

【Rick】 "None of my business...You're on your own."  

I say that as I take a deep gulp from the stein.

Whether or not I join in on the fight wouldn't change anything anyways. I'd just get a beating. 

Both Tiegel and Mag are built prettysturdily, so I figure a little beating andbiting isn't going to kill them.

Even if the barkeep would like to stopthem, it's not really a big deal, you'll getfights in a tavern like weeds in a garden,so you're unlikely to see all the ruckus in the bar die down at once. 

Jeez it's really astonishing. 

I'd gladly leave this village and all thispointless fighting behind me and fly off to that new world. 

As I picture myself flying off to the other world, I gulp down what's left in mystein.

【Rick】 "You two, stop fooling around already-!" 

Since I've run out of beer, I'm alsolosing my interest in watching them fight.

【Striped Tail 1】 "Guh... nuh... uh" 

【Tiegel】 "Phew... Nng..." 

It's taken a while, but finally none of them can stand up anymore, so the fight isover. 

Tiegel and Mag are completely trashed,just like the bar's chairs and tables.

"I'm really sorry" and "Please excuse this" 

and "As long as you pay the repair costs, a fight isn't bad at all" I hear the barkeepsay.

He's as round as a barrel with arms full of old scars.  

I search Tiegel's breast pocket for his bonus money and hand it to the barkeep to pay for the damages.

I don't know what the striped tails are going to do about this. 

I just leave the bar, dragging the twobehind me until I reach the town's fountain.

Leaving this place I hate to go to a newworld makes me look like a coward. But it's not like I'm running away, I'm going thereto explore that new world.

Just like my father. I wonder how dad feltas he took off back then. 

I look up to the white moon in the nightsky.

【Rick】 "One day, to fulfill my dream, I will have to break into your sky, when that time  comes, please turn a blind eye to it."

I put my hands against each other and say a prayer, something I rarely do.

・・・・

There is no special treatment for Napp's  disease, but it is not something that would kill him either, if it should be ignored. 

The doctor said that there is nothing toworry about as long as he doesn't exert himself.

However, he is inevitably struck by coughing fits from time to time,

though they are quite easily suppressed by medicine.

I sometimes go pick medicinal herbs tohelp with those fits. 

It's the same island where I go fishing.  

Lots of good quality medicinal herbs grow there on the waterfront.I could just go and buy medicine, but the herbs growing on the island seem to workbest for Napp's body. 

I arrive at the riverbank and hop acrosson the conveniently lined up stones in thewater.

The island is quite large, and Amorea flowers bloom vividly on it, making it look like a flower garden. 

I carefully gather the medicinal herbsgrowing on the waterfront.

Since the ones with a deep green color arethe best, I examine them carefully firstlike a botanist.

I have gathered almost all the good onesand stand up. 

A cool breeze from upriver blows against thenape of my neck.

I gaze at the empty, spacious flower fieldThe light purple petals sway as a refreshingly sweet scent grazes my face.

My whiskers tremble slightly. It’s not the flowers, there's another  smell...Is there someone else here but me?

When I turn around, there is... 

A girl I've never seen. 

Our eyes meet.

The girl's fur is a light peach color.  Her tail is wrapped in a piece of cloth.

It looks like she came from the direction of Zapat, but since her tail is wrapped upI can't tell which village she is from. 

Just by looking at her from afar I cantell that she is very cute and her redwrapping really suits her.

All these thoughts come to me in a briefmoment just after our eyes met. 

It seems as though she is here to pickAmorea flowers as she is holding a few in her hand. 

I want to know more about her, but what should I do?

What should I do? 

● Talk to her.
○ Don't talk to her.
