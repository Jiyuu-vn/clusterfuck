A few days later...

Will
	"...I guess Cliff-kun's work is getting decent."
Will
	"...After about 3 more months of training, I can leave them in charge and we can go look for more students."
Iry
	"Sensei. There's a letter from Liguria's Guild Master. It's express delivery."
Will
	"Express delivery? From Anna?"
	
Will
	"Hmm..."
Will
	"What...!?"
Iry
	"What did Anna-san say?"
Will
	"...Sorry, but start packing. We're heading to Liguria right away."
Iry
	"Did something happen?"
Will
	"Yeah. It seems things are bad over there."
Iry
	"Bad?"
Will
	"Read it."

Iry reads the letter.

Iry
	"Um... There's a serial killer in the neighboring town?"
Iry
	"The victims are all Hunters... What is this!?"
Will
	"I don't know... That's why we need to go there in a hurry."
Will
	"Hunters can't be killed by mere serial killers. We wouldn't be able to fight monsters if we're that weak."
Will
	"They might've been caught off guard or the enemy was that strong..."
Will
	"Either way, I don't think this is a normal serial killer, considering how this guy's only after Hunters."
Will
	"It's obvious that someone is targeting Hunters for some reason."
Iry
	"Who could it be...?"
Will
	"I don't know. But many Hunters are already dead because of this guy."
Will
	"A normal Hunter won't stand a chance against this guy..."
Will
	"So that's why they came to us, the strongest in the Hunter's guild."
Iry
	"Strongest?"
Will
	"Right?"
Iry
	"Yup."
Will
	"...Right. I don't know when there'll be a next victim. We'll head out right away."
Iry
	"Oh... But..."
Will
	"What?"
Iry
	"I wonder if Cliff-kun and others will be all right."
Will
	"I believe it's too early for them, but..."
Will
	"This is part of the training. I'm sure they'll work together and manage."
Will
	"Either way, we had to eventually leave them in charge to go find new members."
Will
	"It's just that the time came earlier."
Iry
	"Yeah... But this is a sudden test for them."
Will
	"All right. Let's go."

Lucy
	"...So I hear that's what happened and Sensei left."

Lucy shows the letter from Liguria.

Lucy
	"Seeing what it's about... I don't think they'll be back anytime soon."
Cliff
	"It must be hard for them as well."
Mena
	"But what'll happen to the Academy if they're not here?"
Aoi
	"We will have to do with ourselves, of course."
Aoi
	"First of all, we will need a Substitute Academy President."
Lucy
	"You're right. Since Sensei won't be back for a while, we'll need someone to be in charge."
Cliff
	"...Why are you looking at me!?"
Lucy
	"Well... you're the only man here, right?"
Mena
	"I think Cliff is the best choice too."
Aoi
	"I do not mind who it is."
Cliff
	"Even Mena...?"
Lucy
	"Give up and be a man. We'll leave it to you, Substitute Academy President."
Cliff
	"Um... Okay."
Aoi
	"Please stand firm if you are a man."
Cliff
	"O-Okay!"
Lucy
	"So... Our place has a small bath, right? Why don't we make it better?"
Cliff
	"Wait, that's too sudden..."
Aoi
	"Right, I do not think it is possible right away. Here you go."
Cliff
	"Aoi-san... what's this key?"
Aoi
	"The safe is over here."
Cliff
	"Oh, thank you."

I take the key and open the safe. Inside...

Cliff
	"Um... one, two..."
Aoi
	"This is all the operation fund of this Academy."
Cliff
	"This is it...?"
Lucy
	"This is bad. This will only buy us enough food for 3 days at most."
Aoi
	"...A week for normal people. You eat too much, Lucy-san."
Lucy
	"Well, with all jokes aside, this is really bad. We won't make enough money with our jobs."
Mena
	"I'll look for a job too. I can't just sit around."
Lucy
	"Wow, you're so great, Me-chan."
Cliff
	"Oh, I'll do that too."
Lucy
	"I appreciate the offer, but..."
Aoi
	"There are many things we need to have you do as the Substitute Academy President."
Cliff
	"Many things...?"
Aoi
	"We are Hunters. Our part-time jobs are just temporary."
Aoi
	"If the Academy President goes out to work, our work as Hunters will stop as well."
Lucy
	"So we can't have Ku-chan working."
Cliff
	"B-But that's..."
Lucy
	"So you just need to go find us jobs as Hunters."
Lucy
	"Jobs for Hunters are much more high-paying."
Cliff
	"I-I'll do my best..."
Lucy
	"Then we'll leave you to that. We'll make enough money until you find us a job."
Lucy
	"Let's work hard, make money, and build a big bath!"
Cliff
	"Oh...!"
	
I suddenly remember.

Cliff
	"Hold on. There's money."
	
I open the desk drawer and take out the "emergency fund" Iry-Sensei entrusted me with.

Aoi
	"Where did this money come from, Cliff-san?"
Cliff
	"Iry-Sensei entrusted me with this for emergencies."
Lucy
	"Nice work, Iry-Sensei. She sure is reliable."
Cliff
	"But... we can't just just spend it because we have the money."
Cliff
	"We have to work hard to pay for our own expenses."
Lucy
	"I know, Substitute Academy President."


Aoi
	"Where did this large sum of money come from, Cliff-san!?"
Cliff
	"Iry-Sensei entrusted me with this for emergencies."
Lucy
	"Nice work, Iry-Sensei. She sure is reliable."
Cliff
	"But... we can't just just spend it because we have the money."
Cliff
	"We have to work hard to pay for our own expenses."
Cliff
	"So we'll wait on the bath thing."
Lucy
	"I know, Substitute Academy President."

	
Aoi
	"Where did this money come from, Cliff-san?"
Cliff
	"Iry-Sensei entrusted me with this for emergencies."
Lucy
	"Emergency? But this doesn't help at all..."
Aoi
	"Do not complain. We have to consider this as a great help."
Cliff
	"Yeah. It's important money Sensei left for us."
Cliff
	"Anyway, we have to be prepared to work hard and pay for our own expenses."
Lucy
	"I know... I know... but..."
Mena
	"I'll work hard and find a job too."
Cliff
	"Yeah... Thanks."
Cliff
	"Let's all work together until Sensei returns."
Aoi
	"I will help as well."
Lucy
	"Let's completely remodel this place and surprise them when they come back!"
	
And our chaotic life starts like this...
