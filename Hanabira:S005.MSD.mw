  >> <082D> Love's Labours Lunch=

  <08F9> GS_CUD=
  <097D> The noon chime rings out.=
  <0A0A> Already, my stomach was practically cringing　　with hunger.=
  <0ABA> During class, I had been desperate enough   　　that I had prayed to Mary to keep my stomach　　silent.=
  <0B95> Please forgive me for making such a request.=
  <0C35> But it did allow me to get through class    　　without embarrassment.=
  <0CEF> Thinking such unspeakable things, the voice 　　of a classmate reached my ears.=
  <0DBA> Right now, out in the corridor, Yuuna-senpai　　is coming this way.=
  <0EC5> GS_CLR=
  <0F5A> ...eh?=
  <0FD4> Inside the classroom, a loud rumble of      　　voices started.=
  <1087> And inside my chest, a strong pounding      　　began.=
  <1139> What is going on today, I wonder?=
  <11D6> For her to come to the first-year classrooms　　twice in a day like this is a first, yes?=
  <12AB> It is an opportunity to see her, the reasons　　are not important.=
  <1369> That is true, but still...=
  <144B> GS_CLR=
  <14D8> Was Onee-sama coming to meet with me,       　　perhaps?=
  <15D8> GS_CLR=
  <1665> A feeling of impatient anxiety ran about    　　through my entire body.=
  <1720> Unable to just remain where I was, I rushed 　　out of the classroom.=
  <1813> GS_CUD=
  <1897> The corridor was completely crowded.=
  <192F> Just like this morning, Onee-sama was again 　　completely encircled by first-year students.=
  <1A07> Yuuna-senpai, where were you going with your　　lunch?=
  <1B05> GS_CLR=
  <1B9A> I was coming here, to invite Nanami-san to  　　join me.=
  <1C46> The crowd buzzed.=
  <1CCB> A few shrieks arose from the confusion.=
  <1D6E> Were you going to lunch with all of the     　　committee?=
  <1E24> No, I just thought I would like to have a   　　personal lunch with Nanami-san.=
  <1EE7> The crowd buzzed again.=
  <1F7A> Pardon, Yuuna-senpai, but just what kind of 　　relationship do you have with Nanami-san?=
  <209B> GS_CLR=
  <2130> Heehee, everyone does have a liking for     　　being inquisitive, it seems.=
  <21F8> Ah... forgive me...=
  <227F> The girls seemed to shrink back in shame.=
  <23A7> GS_CLR=
  <2445> O-.... O-....=
  <24C6> Onee-sama, the centre of attention once     　　again!=
  <2570> I managed - barely - to resist the urge to  　　scream.=
  <26A6> GS_CLR=
  <2744> Aah, Nanami-san.=
  <27C8> Spotting me, Onee-sama called out my name in　　a happy-sounding voice.=
  <2883> In unison, the gazes of the crowd turned    　　upon me.=
  <29BA> GS_CLR=
  <2A58> There you are. I came to meet up with you.=
  <2AFE> Shall we go have lunch together?=
  <2B92> Aaiieee!=
  <2C0E> Though happy, I was also worried...=
  <2CA5> How were we going to keep our relationship a　　secret with this kind of attention?=
  <2D6C> Being invited by Onee-sama was heavenly, but　　to accept it here like this...=
  <2EB9> GS_CLR=
  <2F57> Ah... As for having lunch with you, Senpai, 　　I...=
  <308A> GS_CLR=
  <3128> Huh?=
  <31A8> Your invitation is wonderful, but...=
  <3248> My, you do realize that turning down Yuuna- 　　senpai would be discourteous, yes?=
  <3399> GS_CLR=
  <3437> Eh?!=
  <34B7> Indeed, very much a matter of honour.=
  <3550> Gah, they're right.=
  <35D7> This wasn't very different from being       　　invited to a formal tea party that Onee-sama　　had organized.=
  <36B9> If I declined, I'd be getting cold stares   　　from everyone, not to mention that I'd be   　　embarrassing Onee-sama.=
  <37A4> Everyone else aside, embarrassing Onee-sama 　　like that was something I couldn't do...    　　really.=
  <3887> It is a little vexing, but don't let that   　　keep you from going.=
  <3947> We'll certainly want to hear about it       　　afterwards, of course.=
  <3A8C> GS_CLR=
  <3B2A> Haa...=
  <3BAC> I'm not causing any trouble, am I?=
  <3C42> Yes, actually, a little.=
  <3CCE> But, for now, I'll just calmly smile and    　　bear it.=
  <3E05> GS_CLR=
  <3EA3> No, I'm honoured. It seems like a dream to  　　be able to join you for lunch, Senpai.=
  <3FF8> GS_CLR=
  <4096> Ah, wonderful.=
  <4118> Onee-sama responded with a pure smile.=
  <41B2> I did realize there was no malice intended.=
  <4251> But anyone with a decent amount of intuition　　might be able to figure this out, Onee-sama!=
  <441A> GS_CUD=
  <44B6> Carrying our lunches, Onee-sama and I made  　　our way to the back courtyard.=
  <4578> The sunlight-bathed grass was a dazzling    　　green.=
  <4622> The humidity had dropped a bit since        　　morning, and the weather was pleasant.=
  <46EC> However, my heart still felt heavy.=
  <4783> The reason was, naturally, my sudden        　　unexpected visitor..=
  <488F> GS_CLR=
  <4924> Kyaaa♪ I had dreamed of us having lunch    　　together, Nanami.=
  <49E1> Being able to eat alone together like this -　　such happiness♪=
  <4B20> GS_CLR=
  <4BBE> Is that so?=
  <4C3D> At my discouraged reply, a worried look came　　over Onee-sama's face.=
  <4D82> GS_CLR=
  <4E20> Is there something the matter?=
  <4EB2> Yes, something is most definitely the       　　matter.=
  <4F5D> Publicly announcing that the two of us were 　　going to have a private lunch together.=
  <5028> But Onee-sama wasn't able to grasp the full 　　significance of that.=
  <50E1> Still, something needed to be said.=
  <5178> For the sake of our future, I had to clearly　　explain things to Onee-sama here and now.=
  <536D> GS_CLR=
  <540B> Onee-sama, the next time you want to have   　　lunch together, would you let me know ahead 　　of time please?=
  <5579> GS_CLR=
  <5617> The school's idol suddenly showing up at our　　classroom was quite a shock to everyone.=
  <56EB> So that's not a good idea then?=
  <5809> GS_CLR=
  <58A7> You were surrounded by nosy students.=
  <5948> What would happen if you inadvertently said 　　something that let our secret out?=
  <5A99> GS_CLR=
  <5B37> You think I'd just carelessly let something 　　slip out?=
  <5BEC> Not directly, but even that exchange in the 　　corridor was making people suspicious.=
  <5D41> GS_CLR=
  <5DDF> Aah, really?=
  <5EEA> GS_CLR=
  <5F88> Really.=
  <608E> GS_CLR=
  <612C> People do have strong imaginations, you     　　know.=
  <61DD> You can definitely say that, but still...=
  <6282> So, it's alright if I ask you ahead of time 　　then, yes?=
  <63BB> GS_CLR=
  <6459> Yes.=
  <64D9> In that case then, I'll do so now.=
  <65FA> GS_CLR=
  <6698> Eh?=
  <6718> I'd like to make reservations to have lunch 　　with you from now on.=
  <685C> GS_CLR=
  <68FA> Aah... whaat??=
  <6A07> GS_CLR=
  <6AA5> We'll have our lunch together again         　　tomorrow, and the day after, and so on♪=
  <6BFC> GS_CLR=
  <6C9A> Th-th-that would be...!=
  <6DB0> GS_CLR=
  <6E4E> You did say I just needed to ask in advance,　　didn't you?=
  <6F88> GS_CLR=
  <7026> Do you really think people won't figure out 　　what's going on if we are eating together   　　every day?=
  <710C> You don't have to get angry like that...=
  <7266> GS_CLR=
  <7304> Onee-sama, your behaviour earlier is going  　　to get us found out!=
  <73C4> Aah, what precisely do you mean?=
  <74E3> GS_CLR=
  <7581> I mean coming to my classroom to invite me  　　to lunch.=
  <7636> Don't you think people will get suspicious  　　if you suddenly doing such a thing?=
  <7788> GS_CLR=
  <7826> If our secret stops being a secret, then,   　　then...=
  <78D9> You don't need to get so upset.=
  <79F7> GS_CLR=
  <7A95> I am not upset!=
  <7BA3> GS_CLR=
  <7C41> Um, but then why are your cheeks puffing out　　like that?=
  <7CEF> Aaack...=
  <7DF6> GS_CLR=
  <7E94> T-that's not the case.=
  <7F26> Anyway, there would be trouble if people get　　suspicious of us, so can you ask me ahead of　　time after this, please?=
  <809D> GS_CLR=
  <813B> Aaw.... Well, more than making people       　　suspicious, I don't want you to hate me,    　　Nanami.=
  <82A1> GS_CLR=
  <833F> In that case, please remember next time.=
  <8466> GS_CLR=
  <8504> ....Ye-ess, under-stood.=
  <8598> So then Nanami, why don't we have lunches   　　together every day, starting tomorrow?=
  <86ED> GS_CLR=
  <878B> Eeeh?=
  <888F> GS_CLR=
  <892D> You did say it wouldn't be a problem if I   　　asked ahead of time, yes♪=
  <8A76> GS_CLR=
  <8B14> Ah, um... well...=
  <8B99> I didn't expect to get an immediate answer  　　like that.=
  <8C47> But, that is what I said, so I can't take it　　back now.=
  <8D7F> GS_CLR=
  <8E1D> I did say that, but...=
  <8F32> GS_CLR=
  <8FD0> Heehee.... I love you, Nanami.=
  <90ED> GS_CLR=
  <918B> Eh....=
  <9290> GS_CLR=
  <932E> I love you... I really love you.=
  <944D> GS_CLR=
  <94EB> I don't know what would happen to me if you 　　hated me.=
  <95A0> So, please don't be angry? Can't the two of 　　us have our lunch together every day?=
  <96F4> GS_CLR=
  <9792> Uuu....=
  <980D> Onee-sama, the person I loved, was asking   　　this of me.=
  <98BC> As well as telling me again and again how   　　she loved me too...=
  <9973> Those words, they did me in, Onee-sama.=
  <9A0E> Even though I was upset, I couldn't keep my 　　expression from softening.=
  <9B57> GS_CLR=
  <9BF5> It's because I love you, you know...=
  <9C95> Uu...=
  <9D0E> Onee-sama's hand gently wrapped around my   　　own.=
  <9DB6> In that delicate-looking hand, I felt a     　　wondrous tranquility.=
  <9E77> I love you! I love you! I love you!=
  <9F16> I.. I.. I understand! I understand, you     　　don't need to say anything more.=
  <A065> GS_CLR=
  <A103> Yay! Thank you, Nanami!=
  <A18E> My hand received a tight squeeze, and my    　　heart finally started racing.=
  <A24F> Quickly pulling my hand away, I picked up my　　lunch by the knot of the cloth it was       　　wrapped in.=
  <A3B9> GS_CLR=
  <A457> S-so, let's have lunch, Onee-sama.=
  <A578> GS_CLR=
  <A616> Yes, let's.=
  <A695> Onee-sama placed her lunch in her lap as    　　well, and we unwrapped our bundles.=
  <A75C> What kind of things does Onee-sama eat for  　　lunch, I wonder.=
  <A810> Taking a glance, it seemed to be tightly    　　packed with vegetables to go along with the 　　rice.=
  <A8E9> Perhaps having vegetables like that was one 　　of the secrets behind her beauty.=
  <A9AE> Huh? But...=
  <AA2D> On a closer look, it seemed to be mostly    　　cheap microwaved frozen food.=
  <AAEE> What kind of a thing was that for someone   　　from a family as rich as hers!?=
  <ABB1> My own lunches were something that my mother　　made for me when she got up in the early    　　morning.=
  <AC8D> The contrast between our lunches was just a 　　little surprising.=
  <ADCE> GS_CLR=
  <AE6C> Nanami, your lunch looks delicious...=
  <AF0D> That's because my mother makes it for me.=
  <B035> GS_CLR=
  <B0D3> So I see. It's packed full of love, then.=
  <B1FB> GS_CLR=
  <B299> Yes... heehee...=
  <B3A8> GS_CLR=
  <B446> You know...=
  <B4CD> Nanami, I want to have your lunch...=
  <B5F0> GS_CLR=
  <B68E> Let's trade - I'll give you my lunch in     　　exchange, alright?=
  <B7CF> GS_CLR=
  <B86D> Eh?=
  <B8EC> I want to have that lovingly-made lunch of  　　yours, Nanami.=
  <BA29> GS_CLR=
  <BAC7> Lovingly-made? I wasn't the one who made it,　　you realize.=
  <BB7F> That's still fine by me...=
  <BC98> GS_CLR=
  <BD36> My silly Onee-sama....=
  <BDC0> Even as I was saying that, I was thrusting  　　my fist into the air and shouting for joy on　　the inside.=
  <BE9F> I'll eat Onee-sama's lunch even if it did   　　just seem like frozen food.=
  <BF5E> Besides, there was no way that Onee-sama    　　would be eating anything that wasn't        　　delicious.=
  <C0C7> GS_CLR=
  <C165> So, how about it?=
  <C275> GS_CLR=
  <C313> I'm thinking about it...=
  <C42A> GS_CLR=
  <C4C8> Nanami-chaan...=
  <C54B> I didn't want to make this too easy, of     　　course...=
  <C683> GS_CLR=
  <C721> I'll take over for you on day duty.=
  <C843> GS_CLR=
  <C8E1> Eh? That's unreasonable.=
  <C975> Well then, how about I take a test for you?=
  <CA9F> GS_CLR=
  <CB3D> That's still unreasonable. Do you really    　　think that wouldn't be noticed?=
  <CC08> If I do up my hair like yours no one will be　　the wiser.=
  <CD41> GS_CLR=
  <CDDF> There is no way that wouldn't get noticed,  　　so please just stop it. I'm begging you.=
  <CF36> GS_CLR=
  <CFD4> Well, I guess...=
  <D0E3> GS_CLR=
  <D181> Well, there's a summer cottage that...=
  <D2A6> GS_CLR=
  <D344> I don't need that!=
  <D455> GS_CLR=
  <D4F3> My... you really don't have any wants like  　　that then?=
  <D5A9> I'm no different from anyone else, but I    　　don't think that's a fair trade for just a  　　lunch.=
  <D70E> GS_CLR=
  <D7AC> I don't care about that...=
  <D83A> Onee-sama, you're being absurd, or at least 　　off-kilter.=
  <D8E9> But I guess that's love for you.=
  <DA08> GS_CLR=
  <DAA6> I guess I don't have much of a choice. Just 　　this time, mind you, alright?=
  <DBF2> GS_CLR=
  <DC90> So you'll trade with me? Yay, Nanami's      　　lovingly-made lunch♪=
  <DD49> I wasn't the one who made it, silly.=
  <DDE1> But if it makes you happy, Onee-sama, it's  　　fine I guess.=
  <DE92> Besides, it wasn't every day that I was able　　to score points like this.=
  <DFDB> GS_CLR=
  <E079> Well then... Itadakimasu.=
  <E10E> Itadakimasu...=
  <E190> With just a bit of nervousness, I brought   　　out my chopsticks.=
  <E246> The flavour was as I expected, but I still  　　couldn't have been happier.=
  <E390> GS_CLR=
  <E42E> Very delicious. It seems to get better with 　　every bite.=
  <E568> GS_CLR=
  <E606> It's happy to be in your mouth.=
  <E6A1> Heehee... Being your lunch makes it all the 　　more delicious, Nanami.=
  <E7E7> GS_CLR=
  <E87D> Auwaaa....!=
  <E8FC> Those words.... that's foul play!=
  <E999> Heheheee, my little plan was a big success.=
  <EAC3> GS_CLR=
  <EB61> Eh? What little plan, Onee-sama?=
  <EBFD> Oh, nothing, nothing...=
  <EC88> Onee-sama smiled.... and it was not her     　　usual Virgin Mary-like smile.=
  <ED49> She looked as if she had just pulled off    　　some bit of mischief.=
  <EE8D> GS_CLR=
  <EF2B> That didn't sound like it was "nothing"!    　　What did you mean by "plan"?!=
  <EFF4> Ah, Nanami, even your scowl is cute...=
  <F119> GS_CLR=
  <F1B7> Aaugh, Onee-sama!=
  <F23C> That said, I couldn't stay upset.=
  <F35C> GS_CLR=
  <F3FA> Heehee, it wasn't a big deal. I just wanted 　　to trade lunches with you, no matter what.=
  <F553> GS_CLR=
  <F5F1> Eh?=
  <F6F3> GS_CLR=
  <F791> I had just been wondering if you would trade　　out of kindness if my lunch didn't look very　　good...=
  <F8F7> GS_CLR=
  <F995> Haaa....=
  <FA11> In other words...=
  <FA96> For the express purpose of getting my       　　lunch...=
  <FB4A> ...This was made like this, with just frozen　　food, on purpose?!=
  <FC8B> GS_CLR=
  <FD29> Eheeheee...=
  <FE33> GS_CLR=
  <FED1> Wait - did you personally make this         　　yourself?=
  <10009> GS_CLR=
  <100A7> I did. After all, I couldn't exactly ask    　　anyone else to make an unappetizing-looking 　　lunch for me.=
  <10213> GS_CLR=
  <102B1> Hyaaaa.... Onee-sama...=
  <1033C> My strength drained out of me.=
  <103CE> Sometimes, I really didn't understand her   　　way of thinking...=
  <10484> But still, this - this was a lunch that     　　Onee-sama made with her own two hands!=
  <1054E> This lunch was a rare treasure indeed!!=
  <105E9> Even if all she had to do was defrost it...=
  <106C1> GS_EN_NS=
  <1074A> Ah? You have a bit of rice stuck to your    　　cheek.=
  <107FC> Eh...?=
  <1087E> You need to be more careful when you're     　　eating, Nanami.=
  <10931> With an affectionate look in her eyes, Onee-　　sama removed the grain of rice from my face.=
  <10A09> *munch*=
  <10A8C> ...?=
  <10B04> Aack! Did Onee-sama -eat- it?!=
  <10B96> At that unexpected event, my body went      　　rigid.=
  <10C48> Ah... ah, what, what...=
  <10CDB> Ah, Nanami, you taste wonderful.=
  <10D77> Haauuuu....=
  <10DF6> In an instant, my skin turned as red as a   　　boiled octopus.=
  <10EA9> I was embarrassed, but happy too!=
  <10F3E> It was almost as if we were a pair of       　　lovers.=
  <10FE9> Well, no, we really were lovers. However,   　　this was the first time that it really felt 　　like it...=
  <110C7> Too embarrassed to let the words out, I said　　them to myself...=
  <1117C> Onee-sama, I love you!!=
