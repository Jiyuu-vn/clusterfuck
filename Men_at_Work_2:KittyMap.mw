Mena
	"Oh, Cliff. Did you find Kitty-chan?"
Cliff
	"No..."
Mena
	"I wonder where she went..."
Sheryl
	"Kitty-chan, Please reply if you hear me."
Sheryl is floating around, calling Kitty's name.
A ghost that goes around the night town looking for someone. 
It's something you see in ghost stories...
Cliff
	Ѓi...I'm glad nobody walks around at night...Ѓj
Sheryl
	"Oh, Cliff-san. Did you find her?"
Cliff
	"Oh, no."
Aoi
	"Kitty-san, where are you!?"
Cliff
	"A-Aoi-san."
Aoi
	"Oh, Cliff-san..."
Aoi
	"...I know it is useless to call out to her since she ran away, but..."
Cliff
	"Yeah... I know how you feel."
Aoi
	"I wonder where she could be."
...Where did Lucy go?
Lucy
	"Oh, Ku-chan..."
Cliff
	"Oh, Lucy. You were searching from above?"
Cliff
	"Did you find Kitty?"
Lucy
	"Nope. Kitty can fly as well, so we're at an disadvantage."
Cliff
	"But let's not give up and keep searching for her."
Lucy
	"Yeah, I know!"
Mena
	"Kitty-chan! Where are you!?"
Mena's searching around for Kitty.
Sheryl
	"Cliff-san... Did you find Kitty-chan?"
Cliff
	"No..."
Sheryl
	"I'll keep searching."
Cliff
	"Yes, please."
Aoi
	"I cannot find her anywhere..."
Cliff
	"I wonder where she could be..."
Lucy
	"How is it? Did you find Kit?"
Cliff
	"No..."
Lucy
	"She's really making us worry. Where could she be...?"
Cliff
	"Kitty!"
......
I guess Kitty isn't around here...

---

Cliff
	"Haa... haa..."
Mena
	"It's no use... She's not around..."
Sheryl
	"I couldn't find her."
Aoi
	"We can't do anything else..."
Lucy
	"That idiot! Where did she go, leaving a note like this!?"
Cliff
	"Kitty's a bad child, huh...?"
Sheryl
	"No way. Kitty-chan didn't do anything bad."
Lucy
	"Of course not! If she really was a bad child, I would've thrown her away in a dungeon already!!"

---	
	
Cliff
	"Dungeon!!"
Lucy
	"Yes! Dungeon!!"
Mena
	"Eh?"
Lucy
	"I'll explain later! She's probably in the dungeon!"
Aoi
	"The dungeon? Then there is only one place."
Mena
	"The abandoned mine we found her in?"
Sheryl
	"Let's hurry! If there's a slight possibility that she's there..."

---	
	
Kitty
	"......"
Kitty
	"I'm hungry..."
Kitty
	"I want some milk..."
Kitty
	"Sob... sob..."
Kitty
	"...Cliff... Lucy..."
	
---	
	
Lucy
	"Oh, did you call for us?"
Kitty
	"!?"
Lucy
	"I thought so. So you're here?"
Kitty
	"Lucy..."
Lucy
	"Why did you come here? Well, I think I know."
Kitty
	"Because..."
Kitty
	"Because... I'm a bad kid that causes everyone trouble..."
Kitty
	"Bad kids have to be thrown away in a dungeon..."
Lucy
	"...As I thought. You really are stupid, Kit."
Lucy
	"Kit... Did you do something bad?"
Kitty
	"But because of me, you all were..."
Lucy
	"That's not your fault. That mustache guy is just selfishly speaking for himself."
Lucy
	"There's no one in this world that's bad by being there."
Lucy
	"So you haven't done anything bad this time. You can be sure of that."
Lucy
	"So come back. Let's take a bath together, eat, and drink milk."
Kitty
	"I can live with everyone? Like we were until now...?"
Lucy
	"Of course. Why do you think we searched for you so hard?"
Lucy
	"Everyone wants to live with you again."
Kitty
	"Ugh... sob..."
Kitty
	"Waaaaaaaaaan!! Lucy!!"
Lucy
	"You really are stupid... Doing such a stupid thing..."
Kitty
	"Sob. Sob... Lucy..."
Lucy
	"I know, I know. Geez, my clothes are wet."
Kitty
	"Sob... sob..."
Kitty
	"I'm sorry... I'm sorry for making you worry..."
Lucy
	"Yup. You have to apologize for that."
Lucy
	"And you have to take responsibility as well."
Kitty
	"Responsibility?"
Lucy
	"Yup. You ran away and you're sorry... then what should you do?"
Kitty
	"Go back home..."
Lucy
	"Yup. Well done."
Lucy
	"...Let's go back to our house."
Kitty
	"Yeah...!"
	
---	
	
Cliff
	"Oh, Kitty."
Sheryl
	"Geez... we were worried about you."
Kitty
	"Hehe, I'm sorry for making everyone worry."
Mena
	"But I'm glad we found you."
Aoi
	"Let's go. We have not had dinner yet, so I am hungry."
Kitty
	"Me too!"
	
---	
	
Benjamin
	"Hahahaha! Amazing, Wisor-Sensei! They couldn't talk back at all."
Benjamin
	"I am so pleased. This is extremely pleasant."
Wisor
	"No, no. This is also for my interest as well..."
Benjamin
	"Oh yes. I would like it before I forget about it."
Wisor
	"Oh, the egg of the fire spirit? Of course you can have it."
Benjamin
	"I can really have this, right? I won't give it back even if you ask for it later."
Wisor
	"Of course. From this point on, you own that egg."
Wisor
	"It does not concern me what you do with the egg..."
Wisor
	"And I will not concern myself with the egg in the future."
Benjamin
	"Oh, as expected of you. Then I shall certainly take it..."
Benjamin
	"Nwaaaaaa!? A fire just came in!"
Wisor
	"Oh my. It seems the fire spirits have come to retrieve their egg."
Benjamin
	"W-What!?"
Wisor
	"They did not attack when I had the egg, but they must know it is easy to get it back from you."
Wisor
	"The spirits sure are calculating."
Benjamin
	"P-Please don't just stand there! Do something!"
Wisor
	"Oh, no. I think I promised I will not concern myself with the egg."
Benjamin
	"N-No way!!"
Wisor
	"You should take care of it yourself. That is the responsibility of owning that egg."
Benjamin
	"Y-You tricked me!!"
Wisor
	"I never tricked you. I showed you the reward you wanted, and you accepted it according to contract."
Wisor
	"I did not break any promises, nor did I trick you. Please do not falsely accuse me."
Benjamin
	"Noooo! My mansion's going to burn down!!"
	
---	
	
Sheryl
	"Huh...?"
Lucy
	"What's wrong, Sherry?"
Sheryl
	"There's a fire! I see smoke from somewhere!"
Lucy
	"What!?"
Cliff
	"Oh, Lucy!"
Aoi
	"I see. It is more certain to check from above in this case."
Lucy
	"It's terrible! The mustache guy's mansion is on fire!"
Cliff
	"Benjamin-san's house is!?"
Lucy
	"Let's go, Kit!!"
Kitty
	"Eh?"
Lucy
	"We're gonna hurry from the sky! We don't have time to waste!"
Kitty
	"Okay!"
There's a gust of wind and the two are high up in the sky.
Aoi
	"Let us hurry as well!"
Sheryl
	"Okay!"
	
---	
	
Benjamin
	"My mansion is burning... it's going to burn down..."
Servant
	"Benjamin-sama! We have to run away!"
Wisor
	"Hah, that is what you get for being greedy, you lowly human."
Wisor
	"...Hm?"
Lucy
	"Hey! Are you still alive!?"
Wisor
	"Oh... it's the Academy's..."
Lucy
	"What are you standing around for!? You'll burn to death if you don't run!"
Wisor
	"Do not worry. I can run anytime."
Wisor
	"But... it is true that I need to get away soon."
Lucy
	"W-Who are you!?"
Kitty
	"Hey! Drakul!!"
Lucy
	"Kit!! Who is that!?"
Wisor
	"My name is Wisor. The head of the Drakul family, one of the Three Great Families that obtained immortality."
Lucy
	"Wisor...?"
Lucy
	"Could it be...? Are you that scholar-like Wisor-Sensei!?"
Wisor
	"Hah, that was only a face I put on. Was it not good acting?"
Lucy
	"I don't know if your name is Drakul or Krukul... is this fire your doing!?"
Wisor
	"You are falsely accusing me. Well, I might have created the cause..."
Wisor
	"Well... the fire is spreading. I shall retreat now."
Lucy
	"Hold on! Where are you going!?"
Wisor
	"...Come to the old castle if you have business with me. I will not run or hide."
Lucy
	"Hey, hold on! I'm not done..."
Lucy
	"Damn, we don't have time to be talking. Kit, take the servant."
Kitty
	"Okay."
Benjamin
	"It's burning... it's burning..."
Servant
	"Whoa! The ceiling's collapsing!"
	
---	
	
Mena
	"The mansion's...!!"
Sheryl
	"Lucy-san! Kitty-chan!"
Aoi
	"...No, they seem to be all right."

---	
	
Lucy
	"Man, you're too heavy. Go on a diet!"
Kitty
	"Ugg... you're so heavy..."
Servant
	"I'm sorry..."
Benjamin
	"My mansion..."
Lucy
	"You can do anything about the mansion. It's better than dying, right?"
Benjamin
	"Auuuuuu...."
Lucy
	"See. Wasn't it good Kit's at our Academy?"
Benjamin
	"...What?"
Lucy
	"We were able to save both of you since Kit's here."
Lucy
	"If she wasn't, I would've saved your servant and left you burning."
Benjamin
	"Uh... b-but..."
Lucy
	"But what?"
Benjamin
	"That kid is not human, right? I hear she's a dangerous monster... and those wings on her back..."
Lucy
	"...Are you still talking such things? Would a dangerous monster help people out?"
Lucy
	"And I have wings as well. I'm not human, but a Siren."
Benjamin
	"......"
Lucy
	"Give up already. If you protest, I'm gonna suddenly lose my arm strength."
Benjamin
	"H-Hold on! Let me down before that!"
Lucy
	"Ohh... my arms are starting to get numb..."
Benjamin
	"F-Fine! I will allow her to stay, so let me down!"
Lucy
	"Will allow'...?"
Benjamin
	"Oh, I'm sorry. Please have her stay, so please save me..."
Lucy
	"All right. Let 'em down, Kit."
Kitty
	"Are we going to let them go?"
Servant
	"Waaaaaaa!"
Lucy
	"No, no. I mean take them down."
We end up letting them spend the night since they don't have a place to sleep.
And the next day...

Lucy
	"It doesn't matter! It means that Drakul guy tried to destroy my important family!"
Cliff
	"Lucy!?"
Lucy
	"Hold on! I'm gonna go there and settle thing! I'm gonna tell him never to lay hands on my family again!"
Mena
	"Oh, Lucy-san! Where are you going!?"
Lucy
	"The old castle! He's there!"
Aoi
	"Hold on! You might be going against a powerful monster!"
Sheryl
	"She's gone already..."
Cliff
	"It can't be helped. Let's go after her."
We end up bringing them to the Academy since they don't have a place to go.
......
Kitty
	"This is a good place..."
Kitty
	"Cliff, Lucy, Mena, Aoi, and Sheryl..."
Kitty
	"Everyone's kind..."
Kitty
	"They even accept strange people like me..."
Kitty
	"I want to live here forever..."
Kitty
	"I want to be here forever..."
	
	"Are you still saying such things...?"
Kitty
	"!!"
Wisor
	"We are ones who chose to abandon being mere humans to become the proud monster..."
Wisor
	"It is ridiculous to try to live with humans now."
Kitty
	"Drakul...!!"
Wisor
	"I told you... we are proud monsters. We cannot be in harmony with humans."
Kitty
	"That's not true!"
Wisor
	"Hmph... so I guess this is the limit of the Cyphon family..."
Wisor
	"No wonder they were defeated by mere Hunters..."
Wisor
	"...Let me ask you one more time. Are you willing to lend me your powers to create a paradise for monsters?"
Kitty
	"No!!"
Wisor
	"Fine... daughter of the Cyphon family. I will recognize you as my enemy."
Wisor
	"I shall eliminate you along with humans!"
Kitty
	"Heh! I'm going to beat you instead!"
Wisor
	"Oh... You must underrate me to think that you can beat me so easily."
Kitty
	"Cliff's strong! He can beat you easily!"
Wisor
	"Oh... that is amazing."
Wisor
	"But... let me tell you something interesting. No matter how strong he may be, he cannot beat me."
Kitty
	"Why!?"
Wisor
	"It's simple... humans need to sleep."
Kitty
	"!?"
Wisor
	"Nobody can fight back when they are attacked in their sleep."
Wisor
	"I have killed many humans that way."
Kitty
	"Y-You coward!"
Wisor
	"...Girl. I shall make a deal with you."
Kitty
	"Deal...!?"
Wisor
	"If you will accept the deal, I shall promise not to attack the people important for you."
Wisor
	"Not only that. I shall let them live when I make the paradise of monsters."
Kitty
	"W-What kind of a deal is it?"
Wisor
	"...Give me your blood."
Kitty
	"!?"
Wisor
	"I can take in the powers of Cyphon with that."
Wisor
	"...Although it is not as much as Mihairoff's blood, I can obtain more power."
Kitty
	"...Will I die if I give you blood...?"
Wisor
	"Do not worry. Since you are a monster, you will not die."
Wisor
	"Although you will sleep while your powers are lost..."
Wisor
	"Do not worry. It is only like an instant in your infinite life as a Succubus."
Kitty
	"What if I refuse?"
Wisor
	"Then... you shall lose your family one by one starting tomorrow night."
Kitty
	"!!"
Wisor
	"What will your answer be? ...Although you have no choice."
Kitty
	"............"
Kitty
	"Will you really promise not to attack them if I give you my blood?"
Wisor
	"Yes. I shall promise you... as long as they don't come attacking me."
Kitty
	"......All.. right..."
Wisor
	"...I am sure you will need time to bid farewell to your important family. I shall give you a day."
Wisor
	"I will be waiting for you at the church outside of town tomorrow night."
Wisor
	"You know what will happen if you do not come, right?"
Kitty
	"...I won't run away."
Wisor
	"Good... I shall give you my respect for your courageous decision."
Kitty
	"I don't want such a thing! Go away!!"
Wisor
	"Haha... I am hated. Well, it is only natural."
Wisor
	"Hahahaha..."
Kitty
	"......"
Kitty
	"......"
Kitty
	"Cliff......"

---	

Benjamin
	"Oh, my mansion... my furnitures... my treasures... it's all burned..."
Lucy
	"Are you still grumbling?"
Mena
	"It's good enough that you're alive."
Servant
	"She's right. Please cheer up, Benjamin-sama."
Aoi
	"Well, is the story I heard from Lucy-san true?"
Aoi
	"You will approve Kitty-san as a member of our Academy?"
Benjamin
	"Heh... it can't be helped."
Lucy
	"...I'm telling you that you have a big attitude."
Benjamin
	"Damn, don't hit people's head so much."
Cliff
	"Then we don't have to leave the Academy?"
Sheryl
	"I'm really glad."
Benjamin
	"Man... there's a ghost, 2 winged girls... this is a ridiculous school."
Aoi
	"Well... I would like to ask you one more question."
Benjamin
	"W-What?"
Aoi
	"Who is that Wisor guy?"
Benjamin
	"I don't know. I let him stay because he said he's a well-known researcher."
Lucy
	"He was saying something about Drakul... something about immortality and all."
Aoi
	"Drakul...!?"
Benjamin
	"He's the one who told me about the Succubus. He seemed interested in that girl."
Benjamin
	"I was hoping that you guys would go away... but I think he wanted that girl to be isolated."
Lucy
	"W-What!?"
Aoi
	"Drakul... if that is true..."
Aoi
	"We might be facing an outragious monster..."

---	
	
Kitty
	"......"
Kitty
	"It's cold..."
???
	"What are you doing here, girl of the Cyphon?"
Kitty
	"!?"
Wisor
	"Was it fun playing family for a short while?"
Kitty
	"Who are you!?"
Wisor
	"You must have fallen so low to not know me. You may look young, but you have the Cyphon blood."
Kitty
	"......!!"
Wisor
	"Drakul... You regonize the name, right?"
Kitty
	"...What do you want!?"
Wisor
	"Come with me. Lend me your powers so that I can create a paradise for monsters."
Kitty
	"Paradise for monsters...?"
Wisor
	"That's right. We shall eliminate the pitiful humans and create a world of our own."
Kitty
	"No! Cliff and everyone else will die if we kill all humans!"
Wisor
	"Do you not understand!? Humans and monsters cannot live together."
Wisor
	"And humans are worthless creatures."
Kitty
	"They're not worthless! Cliff and Lucy are kind!"
Wisor
	"Hah. You became too attached to them and lost your pride as a monster, huh?"
Wisor
	"Fine... we shall meet again..."
Kitty
	"He disappeared..."
Kitty
	"Humans aren't worthless..."
