Lucy
	"Welcome!!"
Cliff
	"...Thanks for your hard work, Lucy-san."
Lucy
	"Oh, it's just you, Ku-chan."
Cliff
	"Lucy-san... aren't you cold always wearing clothes like that?"
Lucy
	"Oh, are you worried about me?"
Lucy
	"Well, it's still warm right now. I'll wear something over this when it gets cold, so you don't need to worry."
Cliff
	"Oh..."
Lucy
	"And I can't waste the summer. I want to show off when I can, you know?"
Lucy
	"You prefer that too, right?"
Cliff
	"I-I'm not looking at you like that..."
Lucy
	"Oh, you're embarrassed. You're really pure, man."
I wish she'd not make fun of me...

Lucy
	"Hey, Ku-chan. How ya doing?"
Cliff
	"You seem to be busy."
Lucy
	"...That sarcasm hurts, man."
...I'm the only one in the store.
Cliff
	"S-Sorry."
Lucy
	"Well, it can't be helped. Only Hunters use things like these."
Cliff
	"...Yeah."
Lucy
	"Well, wish for more sales for me."
Cliff
	"Okay. Please wish for the Academy's best too."
Lucy
	"Haha. You're right."
I pass an old man as I exit the store.
Cliff
	"That's rare for you to have a customer."
Lucy
	"Sorry customers are so rare here."
Cliff
	"Oh... Sorry. Um..."
Lucy
	"Well, that's what I thought too."
Cliff
	"Oh."
Lucy
	"He bought some weird stuff too. Eastern turtle powder and dried mountain snake."
Cliff
	"You have such things?"
Lucy
	"Actually, he specially had them ordered."
Lucy
	"But... I wonder what he'll use them for?"
Cliff
	"Maybe some ritual?"
Lucy
	"That old guy didn't look like a mage to me."
We wonder for a while.

Lucy
	"Oh, Ku-chan. That old guy was here again."
Is she talking about the one that bought the turtle powder and the dried mountain snake?
Lucy
	"What do you think he bought this time?"
Cliff
	"I don't know."
Lucy
	"Blood of turtle and snake."
Cliff
	"Blood...!?"
I don't know who would actually buy this stuff, but I didn't know about a store that would actually carry such things.
Lucy
	"I asked him what the hell he'd use the stuff for, but he wouldn't tell me anything."
Lucy
	"It might be a strange ritual like you said."
Cliff
	"Hmm..."
He didn't look like a bad person to me.

Cliff
	"Hello."
Lucy
	"Oh, Ku-chan. Welcome."
Cliff
	"Hear about anything involving monsters?"
Lucy
	"There's a rumor. It doesn't sound like a job, though."
Cliff
	"What kind of a rumor?"
Lucy
	"I hear there's an outbreak of mice. I hear everyday about food getting eaten up."
Cliff
	"Oh..."
Lucy
	"I hate it. I'd love to send all mice to hell or something."
But she's right that there's nothing we can do about this rumor.


Lucy
	"Oh, Ku-chan."
Cliff
	"...You look like you're in a bad mood."
Lucy
	"Oh, crap. Smile, smile. It's a basic thing for a service. Welcome!"
Cliff
	"......"
Cliff
	"So... why were you in a bad mood?"
Lucy
	"Well, you try seeing a group of mice on your way here... you'd be depressed too."
Cliff
	"Wow."
Lucy
	"Maybe I'll ask the store owner to get some items to keep them away..."
It seems Lucy really hates mice.

Cliff
	"Hello."
Lucy
	"Oh, Ku-chan. You came at the right time. Take care of the store for a bit."
Cliff
	"Huh!? W-Wait!"
...Lucy runs out the store.
Cliff
	"...What?"
After about 30 minutes, Lucy comes back with a big bag.
Lucy
	"You really helped me out. Thanks."
Cliff
	"You're welcome. What is that?"
Lucy
	"It's emerald fruit. I saw this at the market on my way here."
Lucy
	"I was troubled since I wanted to buy it, but I couldn't leave the store empty."
Lucy's bag contains these brown, hairy, egg-like things.
Cliff
	"Emerald fruit...? This is fruit?"
Lucy takes out a knife and cuts open one of them.
Cliff
	"Wow..."
Lucy
	"It's beautiful, right?"
The cut end is pure green like a real emerald.
Lucy
	"This is a special good in my hometown. I missed it so much that I had to buy some."
Lucy
	"Try it. It's good."
I take a piece Lucy gives me and eat it. Sweet juice fills my mouth... It's really good.
Cliff
	"You're right. It's good."
Lucy
	"Let's ask Me-chan and have her use it to decorate a cake. It'll be really pretty."
Yeah. I think it'll be a beautiful cake.
Lucy
	"Oh, Ku-chan. Can I ask you to look after the store again?"
Cliff
	"Oh, okay."
Is she going shopping again?
Lucy
	"Nope. I'm going to the bathroom."
Cliff
	"Oh... Sorry."
Lucy hurries to the back of the store.

Lucy
	"Man... The Academy's getting crowded. I didn't think a ghost would join."
Cliff
	"Haha. You're right."
Lucy
	"Well, it looks like Aoi's having some trouble. She lives to kill off ghosts, you know?"
Lucy
	"Well... I don't think there are that many ghost with that much guts."
I don't think guts has to do with this...
Cliff
	"Have you heard of any rumors or incidents about monsters?"
Lucy
	"Hmm. This is a rumor, but..."
Lucy
	"I heard that there's a cave where you can hear a girl's crying voice."
Cliff
	"A girl...? Which cave is that?"
Lucy
	"I don't know."
Cliff
	"Oh."
Lucy
	"Hey now. I only heard about it, okay?"
Lucy
	"I'll get more details next time. Gimme a break this time."
Cliff
	"Yeah, please."
	

Lucy
	"Oh, Ku-chan. Aoi was here until a second ago."
Cliff
	"Aoi-san was?"
Lucy
	"She bought many things, saying she'll make sure to send Sheryl to heaven."
Cliff
	"Haha..."
Lucy
	"...What do you think?"
Cliff
	"What do you mean?"
Lucy
	"Do you think you can get her to heaven just by using items?"
Cliff
	"...It's impossible. I'm not saying Aoi-san isn't good enough, but..."
Cliff
	"Aoi-san's skill should be much more than just relying on items."
Lucy
	"Well, you're right. I think so too."
Lucy
	"But, seeing Aoi get in a tussle is worrisome and funny."
Cliff
	"You shouldn't be entertained by this."
But... I think it's a bit easier to talk to Aoi-san recently.


Lucy
	"Hey Ku-chan. I've got something to ask you."
Cliff
	"What?"
Lucy
	"I got something good. Can you pay for it out of our expenses?"
Cliff
	"Something good?"
Lucy
	"It's this."
Lucy puts something that looks like medicine on the counter.
Cliff
	"What is this?"
Lucy
	"It's stuff to keep mice away. I hear mice won't come near it if you put it in the kitchen."
Cliff
	"Wow, that's useful."
Lucy
	"I'll make it cheap too. It's 50 Zel, but how about it for 30 Zel!?"
Um...
I'll buy it
I won't buy it

Cliff
	"No. We have to stop wasting money."
Lucy
	"Wasting money? Come on."
Cliff
	"We have to use our money sparingly. We're poor, you know?"

Cliff
	"All right. It's 30 Zel, right?"
Lucy
	"You're gonna buy it!?"
Cliff
	"Yeah. I can't ignore the damage mice can do."
Cliff
	"I don't think it's a waste of money for things like this."
Lucy
	"Ohhh, that's why I like you! Thanks for your business!"
I'll set this in the kitchen once I go back.

Cliff
	"... Sorry. I don't have money."
Lucy
	"Man... you're useless."
Cliff
	"Come on..."
Lucy
	"Fine. I'll buy it with my own money."
Lucy
	"Man... I feel sad for saying thank you to myself for buying this."
Cliff
	"......"
	

Cliff
	"You look happy, Lucy."
Lucy
	"Well, yeah. I just thought the Academy's getting crowded."
Lucy
	"Although the new ones are strange people like ghosts and Succubus."
Cliff
	"Haha..."
Lucy
	"Well, it's fine because it's fun."
Cliff
	"Yeah."
	
Lucy
	"What's Kit doing right now?"
Cliff
	"I don't know... probably sleeping."
Lucy
	"I see. Come to think of it, she's mostly active at night."
Cliff
	"But I think she sleeps at night as well."
Lucy
	"...Well, she's still a kid."
They say those that sleep grow.

Lucy
	"Now that there are 2 people that can fly, I wonder if we can make a business out of it."
Cliff
	"Like a new job for us?"
Lucy
	"Yup. Can you think of anything good?"
Cliff
	"Like flying taxi or sightseeing flights..."
Lucy
	"......"
Lucy
	"They sound tiring. I guess being a Hunter is easier."
Cliff
	"Haha."

Lucy
	"How's the job thing coming?"
Cliff
	"Hmm... It's pretty hard..."
Lucy
	"I'll get weak if I don't keep on fighting. We could call it training and go beat some monsters somewhere."
Cliff
	"...Like the sewer?"
Lucy
	"...You're getting mean recently."
	
	
Lucy
	"Oh, how's business, Ku-chan?"
Cliff
	"You should know that all too well, Lucy."
Lucy
	"Haha... It's a bit of a recession..."
Cliff
	"Well, I won't give up and keep searching."
Lucy
	"Yeah, please."
	
	
Lucy
	"Oh. Welcome, Ku-chan."
Cliff
	"How's the store doing?"
Lucy
	"Not good at all. You're the third customer today."
Cliff
	"...I'm surprised this store isn't closing down."
Lucy
	"I guess the mail order the store owner's doing for fun is a big hit."
Lucy
	"Thanks to that, he's rich even though the actual store isn't making any money."
Lucy
	"So, this job pays pretty good even though it's not that busy."
Cliff
	"Haha..."
Lucy
	"But still... I'll get weak if I just live peacefully like this."
Lucy
	"Go find us a good job, ok?"
Cliff
	"I-I'll do my best..."
Lucy
	"Oh yeah, Aoi was talking about this, but..."
Cliff
	"What was she saying?"
Lucy
	"I guess some strange air is covering this town."
Cliff
	"Strange air?"
Lucy
	"Yeah. Aoi was calling it evil air."
Lucy
	"You should watch out too. We don't know what might happen."
Cliff
	"Yeah. I'll be careful."
Lucy
	"...It's not because Aoi said it, but..."
Lucy
	"It feels like something bad's about to happen."
Cliff
	"Could there be something?"
Lucy
	"I don't know... but it doesn't hurt to be prepared."
Lucy
	"So I'll let you be in charge of that, Ku-chan."
Cliff
	"Yeah, I know."
Lucy
	"Oh, Ku-chan."
Lucy
	"I'm counting on you for the preparations. I'm ready to go any time."
Cliff
	"Yeah, I know."
Lucy
	"Well, take your time and choose. You don't have to buy anything."
	

There's no one in the store. How careless.
I put the money on the counter and leave.
I exit the store after looking around.
...The store is already closed.

Lucy
	"Thanks! Come again!"
Lucy
	"I'll be waiting for your next visit."
