Will
	"...Hi, Cliff-kun. Are you getting used to the life here?"
Cliff
	"Well... a bit."
Will
	"...Are there any problems?"
Cliff
	"Well... There's a lot going on."
Will
	"...I guess there are."
Cliff
	"...I'm the one at fault, though."
Will
	"Well, all the people around you are women. You have to be considerate about many things..."
Will
	"...Well, good luck. As one of the few men in this Academy."
Cliff
	"...Okay."
Come to think of it, Will-Sensei was the only male Hunter before I came here...
I'm sure he had some tough time here.
Will-Sensei feels closer to me now.

Will
	"Oh, Cliff-kun. What's going on?"
Cliff
	"Um... I had a few things I wanted you to tell me."
Will
	"...Such as?"
Cliff
	"...Well, I don't know how to put this, but..."
Will
	"Are you worried about how to associate with other girls?"
Cliff
	"W-Well, to put it simply, yes."
Will
	"Well, I had problems too when I started, so I understand your worries."
Will
	"I also opened the bathroom door when Aoi was taking a bath."
Cliff
	"Oh, you too?"
Will
	"Yeah. I was in a panic."
Cliff
	"So how did you make it up to her after that?"
Will
	"Nothing, really. We were back to normal the next day."
Cliff
	"Really?"
Will
	"Aoi seems a bit blunt, so it might seem like she hates you..."
Will
	"But she's actually a good person once you get to know her, so don't worry about it too much."
Cliff
	"Yes. Thank you very much."
I see... Maybe I just misunderstood her.

Will
	"What would you like today?"
Cliff
	"Sensei... you seem to be in a good mood."
Will
	"Of course. I'm looking forward to what kind of worries you have today."
Cliff
	"Sensei..."
Will
	"I'm not making fun of you or anything."
Cliff
	"Well, it's not worries, but I wanted to ask you something."
Will
	"Oh, it's not? That's too bad."
Cliff
	"So you were having fun..."
Will
	"Now, now... so what did you want to ask me?"
Cliff
	"Um... Why did you decide to be a Hunter?"
Will
	"Hmmm..."
Will
	"...The biggest reason is that I was bored with my ordinary life."
Cliff
	"Bored?"
Will
	"Yes. I was young back then."
Will
	"I just wanted thrill. That's the only reason I was a Hunter."
Cliff
	"Oh..."
Will
	"Thanks to that, Hunters at that time... well, it was only 3 years ago."
Will
	"But Hunters back then were suspicious and were hated more then anything."
Cliff
	"I-Is that really true!?"
Will
	"But that's too bad for the people who aspire to be Hunters."
Will
	"So as my atonement, I'm running around trying to establish a positive status for Hunters."
Cliff
	"I see."
Will
	"So you do your best and be a Hunter others can look up to, okay?"
Cliff
	"Okay!"
Yes... I have to try my best.

Will
	"...The troubled lamb has come again."
Cliff
	"Sensei..."
I feel like I'm being made fun of, but I still consult Sensei.

This is the Academy President's room... It's Will-Sensei's room.
...No one's here since Sensei's gone right now.
Oh, I hear voices inside. It seems someone's talking inside.

Iry
	"Hold on... Sensei."
Will
	"Nope, I can't wait."
......? What are they talking about?
Iry
	"N-No... Don't do it all of a sudden, Sensei... Ahhh!"
Will
	"I can't help it. We were with Cliff-kun recenty, so we didn't have much of a chance."
Iry
	"But we can't do it here... Auh! What will you do if someone comes...?"
Will
	"It's fine. They went to go take a bath, so they won't be back for at least an hour."
Iry
	"Ahh, oh...! Sensei...!"
Will-Sensei and Iry-Sensei are on the couch.
Iry-Sensei has her front unbuttoned and Will-Sensei is feeling her breasts and legs...

Iry
	"Fua... Not there...!'
Will
	"Oh... you must be in the mood too. You're already wet."
Iry
	"That's because it's been a while for me too. Ahhh, yes, there!"
Cliff
	ЃiT-That's amazing...Ѓj
Cliff
	ЃiW-Well, it's natural since they're married...Ѓj
But I'm peeping...
I can't move or take my eyes off of them.
Cliff
	ЃiIry-Sensei's breasts are beautiful...Ѓj
I knew she had a nice body under her clothes, but what I'm seeing is beyond my imagination.

Will
	"See... you like this, right?"
Iry
	"Ah, more, do more..."
Will-Sensei squeezes her breasts violently. Her breasts change shape.
Cliff
	ЃiSo women really do have soft breasts...Ѓj
I can see a pink perk. Will-Sensei's fingers grab it and rub it.
Iry
	"Ohhh! There, there...!"
Iry-Sensei moans and shakes her long hair.
Will
	"Here, raise your butt..."
Iry
	"Okay..."
Iry-Sensei, who was on Will-Sensei's lap, raises her body.
I realize that her underwear is taken off as well.
I can't see it since it's dark, but Will-Sensei is reaching for her crotch and doing something.

Will
	"All right. You can come down..."
Iry
	"Nn... Ahhhh!!"
Cliff
	ЃiCould it be...?Ѓj
As Iry-Sensei lowers herself, she shakes in pleasure.
Even though I can't see it, I can tell they're connected.
Iry
	"Ohhhh......"
Will
	"...Phew."
After letting all of it in, Iry-Sensei leans back onto Will-Sensei.
Iry
	"You're the best, Sensei."
Will
	"Me too. Yours is the best..."
Iry
	"Really? More than Anna-san?"
Will
	"Hold on! Why do you bring her up!?"
Iry
	"Oh, you're acting suspiciously."
Will
	"That's not true!"
Iry
	"Kyaa!!"
Iry-Sensei suddenly jumps.
Will-Sensei is pushing up from below. Her hair dances through the air with each stroke.
Will
	"See. See."
Iry
	"Nhaaa! ...That's not... fair... Oh!"
Cliff
	ЃiWow, amazing......!Ѓj
Iry-Sensei's breasts shake up and down as their bodies move.
Iry-Sensei's expression is lustful as she distorts her face in pleasure...
Iry
	"...Uh! ...Um! ...Ahh!!"
Their movements are quick and small now.
Will
	"Guh... I'm going to come!!"
Iry
	"Ahh!! Sensei... Please come!!"
Will
	"......!!"
Iry
	"AHHHHH!!"
Iry-Sensei screams as they stop moving.
Their trembling waists are pushing hard against each other.
Cliff
	ЃiSo this is what adults do...Ѓj
It's not that I'm completely ignorant of such things...
But this is my first time seeing others do something like this.
Iry
	"......Ohh..."
Iry-Sensei sighs happily.
Will-Sensei fondles her breasts softly.
Will
	"That was beautiful, Iry..."
Iry
	"Geez... Sensei. You're still hard..."
Cliff
	ЃiWait, does that mean...Ѓj
Will
	"There's still time until everyone comes back..."
Iry
	"Geez... Are you going to keep going until then?"
Will
	"You don't want to?"
Iry
	"...You're mean..."

	
This is too much for me. And it hurts my conscience to keep peeking on them.
I'm a bit reluctant, but I leave...

When I go into the room, Will-Sensei is looking for something behind a picture frame.
Cliff
	"Are you looking for something, Sensei?"
Will
	"Huh!? O-Oh, it's you, Cliff-kun. You surprised me."
Cliff
	"Is there something behind the picture frame?"
Will
	"N-No...I was just chasing after a fly..."
Cliff
	"A fly?"
Will
	"W-Well... I think it got away."
...I look around, but I don't see any flies.
Cliff
	"Huh? What do you have behind your back?"
Will
	"N-No, it's nothing."
...What's Sensei so worried about?

Iry
	"What are you doing, Sensei?"
Will
	"Hi, Iry. You sure are beautiful today."
Iry
	"...What're you doing, hiding like this?"
Will
	"N-Nothing. I wasn't hiding or anything."
Iry
	"...Then what's that behind your back?"
Will
	"Um... well..."
Iry
	"Give it to me."
Will
	"All right..."
Sensei takes out the envelope behind his back. 
Iry-Sensei's scary even though she's smiling...
Iry
	"I thought so! You have so much secret savings!"
Will
	"I-It's not! This isn't money for myself. This is money saved up for emergencies..."
Iry
	"...All right, I'll say it is. Then you have no problem with me keeping it, right?"
Will
	"Man..."
Iry
	"Cliff-kun. Come over here."
Cliff
	"Yes?"
I wonder what she wants.
Iry
	"I'll entrust you with this money."
Cliff
	"What!?"
Iry
	"It's not an allowance or anything. This is for emergencies, okay? Sensei said so."
Cliff
	"W-Why me...?"
Iry
	"Sensei might take it back if I keep it with me."
Cliff
	"Haha..."
...I guess I'll keep this in the desk.
