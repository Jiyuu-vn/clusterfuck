I smell something good from the kitchen.
Mena
	"Oh, Cliff."
Cliff
	"It smells good."
Mena
	"Yeah, ground meat was cheap today at the market, so I made some hamburg steak with cheese."
Mena
	"You like it, right?"
Cliff
	"Yeah, I'm looking forward to it."
Mena
	"That's good."
Mena
	"......?"
Mena
	"Oh!!"
Cliff
	"W-What!?"
Mena
	"That's terrible! You can't just go ahead and eat it just because you like it!"
Cliff
	"W-What!?"
I look at the table to find an empty plate. It probably had some hamburger steak with cheese on it.
Cliff
	"N-No! I just came here!"
Mena
	"If it's not you, who did it?"
Cliff
	"I-I don't know..."
Lucy
	"It smells good. Are we having hamburg steaks today?"
Lucy
	"...Why the scary face, Me-chan? Did Ku-chan secretly ate the food?"
Cliff
	"I didn't!"
Mena
	"But you were the only one here..."
*Munch* *Munch*
Mena
	"Oh! The one I just made is gone too!"
Aoi
	"What is it? It seems to be loud..."
Cliff
	"Whoa! Look by our feet!!"
Lucy
	"Ugyagya!? M-Mice!!"
Aoi
	"Where did all these mice come from!?"
Cliff
	"W-Was it them!? Did they eat our hamburg steak!?"
Mena
	"This is for our dinner!!"
Lucy
	"Man, that was a surprise. Where did all the mice come from?"
Aoi
	"It is too early to relax."
Lucy
	"W-What's up, Aoi!? Why are you saying such things!?"
Aoi
	"...Please face reality. I saw a few run into the hallway."
Lucy
	"D-Don't kid me..."
Aoi
	"Ou... These are ferocious mice."
Lucy
	"That's why I hate mice."
Cliff
	"So... Where did they go?"
Mena
	"They ran away to the hallway."
Lucy
	"D-Don't kid me..."
Mena
	"We should split up. Aoi-san and I will search downstairs. Please search upstairs, Cliff and Lucy-san."
Cliff
	"All right."
Lucy
	"I-I'll scream loud if I find them, so come quickly."
Aoi
	"I know."

Cliff
	"Hmm... They don't seem to be around."
Lucy
	"Man... I won't be able to sleep alone if we don't find them."
Cliff
	"Will you sleep in Aoi-san's room?"
Lucy
	"I can't relax when I sleep on the floor."
Lucy
	"Hey... Can I sleep with you if we can't find the mice?"
Cliff
	"W-What!?"
Lucy
	"But I'm scared of mice!"
Cliff
	"B-But..."
*Squeak*
Lucy
	"Hiii!!"
Cliff
	"Did you hear that?"
Lucy
	"I didn't hear it, I didn't hear it."
You don't have to shake your head that much...
Cliff
	"I've never went in here. What room is this?"
Lucy
	"It's storage room. Above it is the machinery room of the clock tower."
Cliff
	"I'm looking in there."
Lucy
	"What?"
Cliff
	"We can't sleep until we look in there."
Lucy
	"It's fine. I'll just sleep in your room."
Cliff
	"I-I'm going to look in here."
	
Cliff
	"Mena and Aoi-san are searching downstairs."
Lucy
	"...L-Let's go look around."

Cliff
	"This is Aoi-san's room."
Lucy
	"Are there mice here?"
Cliff
	"I can't really tell because it's dark, but I don't think they're here."
Lucy
	"I see. Then let's go to another room."
We search Aoi-san's room again.
Lucy
	"Hey, we already searched this room. Shouldn't we search somewhere else?"
Cliff
	"...You're right."
We leave Aoi-san's room.

Lucy
	"This is my room."
Lucy
	"It's not here, right? They aren't here, right?"
Cliff
	"...No, I don't think so."
Lucy
	"Phew... that's good."
Cliff
	"Then let's go search the other rooms."
We search Lucy's room again.
Lucy
	"Hey. I'm going to shut this room tight, so let's go somewhere else."
Cliff
	"...Okay."
We leave Lucy's room.

Cliff
	"This is an empty room."
Lucy
	"The mice doesn't seem to be here."
Cliff
	"Nope. Let's search the other rooms."
Cliff
	"We searched this room already."
Lucy
	"Come on... I can't sleep unless we quickly find them."
	
Cliff
	"This room doesn't seem to be used by anyone."
Lucy
	"T-They don't seem to be in this room either."
Cliff
	"Nope. Let's search the other rooms."
Lucy
	"We're done with this room, right? We searched it already."
Cliff
	"Yeah. Then let's search through the other rooms."
	
Cliff
	"Are the mice here?"
Lucy
	"Please don't be here."
*Thump*
Lucy
	"Gya!!"
*Squeak*
Lucy
	"They're here!!"
Lucy
	"They're here!! Something's definitely here!!"
Cliff
	"Whoa!! I-I can't see anything, Lucy!"
Lucy
	"But look in the corner over there!!"
Cliff
	"I'm saying I can't see anything!"
Lucy
	"Oh! They ran into the hallway!"
Lucy
	"AOI!!! ME-CHAN!!! They're upstairs!!"

---
	
Aoi
	"This should be all of them."
Lucy
	"Phew... we're saved."
Mena
	"Aoi-san and I were searching the first floor and found a big hole behind the stove."
Mena
	"I think the mice came in from there."
Aoi
	"It is only temporary repairs, but the hole is closed off now. I do not think mice will enter from there again."
Mena
	"I also found someone's pot holder."
Lucy
	"I see. Then let's have dinner. I'm hungry because we moved around a lot."
Mena
	"U-Um..."
Lucy
	"...What's wrong, Me-chan?"
Mena
	"I let my guard down and the mice ate all the ingredients for tonight's dinner."
Cliff
	"What!?"
Aoi
	"...Well, it is unfortunate, but it cannot be helped. We shall go to Hanna-san's place to eat."
Lucy
	"Yeah. That's good once in a while."
Mena
	"Ou..."


Lucy
	"G-Get away! Go over there!!"
...The mice run outside after creating a lot of commotion.
Aoi
	"It seems they all went outside."
Lucy
	"...Are you sure there aren't any more mice?"
Cliff
	"I'm pretty sure..."
Aoi
	"We were searching the kitchen and found a big hole behind the stove."
Mena
	"I think the mice came in from there. The hole's plugged up, so it's all right now."
Lucy
	"I-I see."
Mena
	"But the mice ate all the food for today."
Lucy
	"What!?"
Cliff
	"Then we're skipping dinner?"
Aoi
	"That will be too unfortunate."
Mena
	"I''m sorry, but that's what happened... So let's eat at Hanna-san's place tonight."
Cliff
	"Yeah. That's good once in a while."
We eat dinner at Hanna-san's place that day.
For some reason, everyone ordered hamburg steak with cheese...
