    "It circled around my head twice, enticing me with its azure wings, before being carried away further by the wind."
    "Being the youthful boy I was then, I gave chase, drawn by its lollipop coloured wings."
    "I followed it across the grassy field, over the river, and finally, up a green hill where only a single tree stood."
    "By the time I reached the lonesome tree, I was exhausted."
    "My chest heaved in and out as I saw the butterfly flutter further up into the sky, towards the distant town, and eventually disappear."

    gi "Looky, looky."
    "Startled by the voice, I spun around."
    ri "Wha...?"
    gi "Here, here!"
    "I looked upward, to find a girl roughly about my age sitting on top of a branch."
    ri "What are you doing up there?"
    gi "Lookin' at the town. Come on up here! The view's great."
    "With a bit of caution, I tried to climb up the tree without much success."
    gi "Sigh... Here, grab on."
    "The girl reached down with her hand."
    "She hoisted me up with unusual strength. Surprised by her grip, I barely managed to grab onto the branch on time."
    ri "Whew..."
    gi "Come on, look, look! Isn't is awesome?"

    "A spectacular view laid before me."
    "The white buildings of the town glittered like fine rectangular crystals against the falling sun."
    "Divided by a sparkling river and surrounded by mountains on all sides, our town was like a small sanctuary in the middle of nature."
    ri "Amazing!"
    gi "Ahaha! I can see my home from here!"
    ri "Where, where?"
    gi "Ummm... It should be... right there!"
    "She pointed to a vague section of the town."
    ri "Then... I think my home's... right over there!"
    gi "Ehhh? You live just across the river from me!"
    ri "Which school do you go to?"
    gi "Kawada Elementary School."
    ri "Really? I go to Sakura Elementary, further down the road."
    gi "Alright! Then let's walk to school together from now on, okay?"
    ri "E-eh? But I don't even know your name yet...!"
    gi "Eheheh... My name's Nonami Kitahara. I'm five and a half."
    ri "My name's Riku Saionji. I'm six years old."
    no "Eh!? No way!"
    ri "N-no, my name seriously is Riku..."
    no "Phooey. That's not what I meant, dummy."
    
    "And so, a lost butterfly, brought by the wind and taken away just as unpredictably by the wind, lead me to Nonami Kitahara."
    "An act of random chance. Had the wind blown any other direction, had there been no butterfly, had I not been standing at that exact place at that exact time, I would never have met her."
    "An act of fate."
    
    "Like the notes of a piano, a hundred seemingly random noises come together to create a single melody."
    "Like the random, uncontrollable wind that brought me to Nonami that day, the same wind could just as easily take her away for eternity."
    "Chaos. The inescapable law of our lives."

    "This wasn't my home."
    "I thought those words as I followed my father into our new house."
    "It had been nearly ten years since I've lived in this country."
    "Because of my father's job as a diplomat, I had followed him throughout the world."
    "First Korea. Then France. Then America. Who knew where I would end up in the next moment."    
    "A large, empty room greeted me as I entered the house."

    "Since she was going to be hospitalized from now on, my younger sister, Sora, was going to come live with us."
    "Even though my parents have been divorced for as long as I could remember, I guess she was still family."
    "I only had three memories of ever having met Sora in my life."
    "The first two times were too far ago in my childhood and blurred with time."
    "The third time, however, I could remember much more clearly."
    "It was about three years ago, when my father and I stopped by Japan for two days during summer vacation."
    "We had gone to a small restaurant together. Much of the details of that time were lost, but I still remember Sora eating an ice cream sundae with me."
    "She spoke hardly a word that time."
    "There was an emotionless, sad aura about her, like a frozen pond covered with snow."
    "Her eyes were unfocused, gazing blankly at the table underneath her. She never looked at my face."
    "That was all that I could recall from that day."
    "There was still a week left before she would move in."
    "By the time I finished setting up all of my belongings, it was late afternoon."
    "Since my father was still downstairs, busy unpacking his belongings, I went out of the house and looked around the neighborhood."

    "As I made my way towards the hill, I saw how much the town had changed since I left."
    "The field of tall grass that I once played in was now replaced with a new shopping mall."
    "The tiny stream that I would cross every day was now a cemented waterway."
    "Brand new houses lined the once verdant hill. A spiraling road lead to the top."

    "At the very top of the hill, I found a small fenced off park with the same tree of many years ago."
    "It was still here."
    "I sat down at a nearby bench."
    "The sun was now setting. The tree cast long shadows against the dirt ground, silhouetting it with a black pattern."
    ol "Times are a changing, young lad..."
    "From seemingly out of nowhere, an old lady appeared behind me."
    "Her back was bent with age and time had turned her hair thin and white."
    "She sat down on the bench beside me and looked at the tree with her tired, grey eyes."
    ol "I say, there was a time when this entire place was nothing but green. Now those young folk come in with that new mall and done changing everything."
    "I could barely understand the old lady's Japanese through her thick Kansai accent, so I just nodded politely."
    ol "Now, none of the birds even come around. Nobody to keep this old woman company."
    "She continued to speak. Out of respect for the elderly, I pretended to listen, even though I couldn't make out most of her words."
    ol "This old park is all that's left. All that's left of my old memories. Eh-heh... I guess that's why I like to come back here. Old habits are hard to kill..."
    "I wasn't sure what to say to the old lady, but I felt like I had to say something, lest she think I was ignoring her."
    ri "I used to come here often too."
    ol "Ooohhh, you did, did you?"
    ri "I always wanted to come back."
    ol "And why's that, my dear?"
    ri "There's someone I'm supposed to meet here. I hope she hasn't been waiting for too long."
    ol "Ohh... someone special, is it?"
    ri "... ... ..."
    ol "Well, I don't imagine a young lad like you'd be waiting on a old woman like me. Wahahaha."
    "A breeze blew through the park, filling the air with a flurry of white sakura petals. For a moment, it felt as if small puffs of snow were falling from the blue spring sky."
    "Nostalgia filled me. I had sat here long ago and watched the white petals softly glide to the ground before. The distant taste of old candy trickled from my mouth."
    "Had I been eating candy that day?"
    "Suddenly, I heard what sounded like a baseball bat being swung on the other side of the park. I turned my head and saw a lone kendoka practicing."
    "I watched quietly as the girl swung her bamboo sword over her head."
    "There was a kind of aesthetic beauty to it, to see a lone girl in traditional clothing gracefully cutting the air against the setting sun."
    "After swinging her sword for a few minutes, she stopped and bought a sports drink from a vending machine."
    "While she was drinking, she noticed me and waved."
    "I stood up and turned to bid my farewell to the old lady, but saw that she was now nowhere to be seen."
    "Huh, strange, she must have walked off while I was busy looking."
