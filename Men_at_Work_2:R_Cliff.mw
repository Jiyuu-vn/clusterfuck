This is my room.
What should I do?
—Go to bed
—Go somewhere else
—Stay in my room

What should I do?
—Go to sleep
—Go somewhere else

...I guess I'll go somewhere else.

It sure was a hard day today...

...It's late. I should go to bed.

Drowsiness overtakes me as I get in bed.
Zzz...

Phew... I'm sweaty. I'll get changed.
Phew... I'm sweaty. I'll get changed.
I decide to kill some time in my room.
I take my jacket off so I that I can change. 
I can have Mena wash it tomorrow.

Mena
	"I brought you clean clothes, Cliff."
Cliff
	"Whoa!? Mena!?"
Mena
	"Oh. Did you just take this off? I'll wash this for you tomorrow."
Cliff
	"Y-Yeah... Thanks..."
Mena
	"...What's wrong?"
Cliff
	"I'm changing right now..."
Mena
	"What are you saying, Cliff? I've seen you naked since we were kids."
Cliff
	"That might be true, but..."
Mena
	"Then I'll be taking your dirty laundry. Oh, can you put your sheet out tomorrow?"
Mena leaves.
Cliff
	"Well, we're used to seeing each other naked..."
We've been living together for more than 10 years.
I take my clothes off to get changed.

Aoi
	"Um, Cliff-san. About tomorrow..."
Aoi
	"S-Sorry about that!!"
Aoi-san sees me changing and runs out the door.
Cliff
	"Yeah. That's the normal reaction."
	
I take off my coat to get changed.
I'll have Mena wash it again tomorrow.

Mena
	"I brought your laundry, Cliff."
Cliff
	"Oh, great timing. Can you wash this tomo-"
Mena
	"I-I'm sorry!"
Cliff
	"Whoa!"
Mena throws the laundry at me and runs out the room.
Cliff
	"What's up with Mena today?"

	
Mena
	"That was surprising. Cliff was changing."
Mena
	"...My heart's still pounding..."
Mena
	"That's strange. I should be used to seeing Cliff's body..."
Mena
	"I yelled at him earlier for seeing me naked too..."
Mena
	"What's wrong with me?"

I crawl into my bed and think about what happened recently.
My dad died, and I decided to come to the Academy...
I met Lucy and Aoi-san...
Sheryl appeared...
And we found Kitty...
Come to think of it, we're all without relatives...
Losing our parents and coming here...
That might be why everyone's so kind here.
Everyone lost their family once, but found this new family here again.
I want to protect this place...
I fall alseep as I think about these things...
