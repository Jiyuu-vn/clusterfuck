Iry
	"Well... Where should we start?"
Iry
	"I guess we'll start off with the shops that we frequent."
	
---
	
Cliff
	"...This is where you go the most often?"
Iry
	"Yeah, at least for me."
Cliff
	"Haha..."
Iry
	"This place has the best tea in town. The owner's very particular about making tea."
Iry
	"And the waffles here are really good."
Mena
	"...Won't you get fat?"
Iry
	"I can just exercise as much as I eat. You'll be moving a lot if you're a Hunter."
Mena
	"Oh... you're right about that."
Cliff
	"......But there isn't anybody working here."
Iry
	"Oh. The Master here's running this establishment by himself."
Cliff
	"But the Master isn't here either. Maybe he's out delivering?"
Iry
	"Well... the Master here's pretty shy."
Iry
	"So he rarely comes out in front of people he doesn't know."
Cliff
	"It's amazing how the Master can still operate a business."
Iry
	"I guess it's a lot of trouble."
Iry
	"I'd love to treat you guys, but I guess we'll put that off until next time."
	
---
	
Iry
	"Well... Let's go to the weapon shop next."

---
	
Weapon Shop Owner
	"Welcome!"
Iry
	"Hello, Master."
Weapon Shop Owner
	"Oh, it's you. What would you like today?"
Iry
	"I wanted to introduce you to these two. This is Cliff-kun and Mena-chan. They're Hunter candidates."
Cliff
	"Nice to meet you."
Mena
	"...Please give me your best regards."
Weapon Shop Owner
	"Oh, so they're the new guys, huh? They're cute Hunters."
Weapon Shop Owner
	"Well, I know that people like us are very rare."
Iry
	"This person is a Hunter too. Well, was."
Cliff
	"Is that so?"
Weapon Shop Owner
	"Yeah. I'm selling weapons for ordinary people, but my real job is to draw out the abilities of Hunters."
Cliff
	"Abilities?"
Iry
	"Yes. It's his special ability."
Weapon Shop Owner
	"Hunters can't let out their true powers even if they gain experience."
Weapon Shop Owner
	"So what I do is help draw out that power."
Iry
	"Come here if you think you've gotten stronger."
Cliff
	"All right. Please give me your best regards."
Mena
	"Please give me your best regards."
Weapon Shop Owner
	"Yeah! I'll be waiting for your next visit!"
	
---	
	
Cliff
	"He's a cheerful guy."
Iry
	"But I don't know about his loud voice."
Mena
	"...My ears hurt a bit."
Iry
	"Then we'll head to the item shop next."
	
---

Lucy
	"Welcome!"
Cliff
	"H-Huh?"
Iry
	"I appreciate your efforts, Lucy. You're working hard, I see."
Lucy
	"Huh? Iry-Sensei, Ku-chan, and Me-chan?"
Mena
	"So this is where Lucy-san works?"
Lucy
	"Yup. I guess being a salesgirl suits me."
Lucy
	"So... what do you want? I even appreciate window shopping."
Iry
	"I'm just showing these two around town, so we're not really here to shop..."
Lucy
	"Oh? Well, you can look around. We have the best stuff here."
Cliff
	"But it doesn't look like you have medicine."
Lucy
	"Oh, we don't sell such things. You should go to the church for that."
Lucy
	"I think Aoi is selling stuff there at this time."
Mena
	"Aoi-san is working at the church?"
Lucy
	"Yeah. She wanted to work at a temple, but there isn't one in this town."
Lucy
	"When in Rome, do as the Romans do, so she's working at the church."
Mena
	"R-Really?"
Lucy
	"Well, don't worry about it. She's just working where she can."
Cliff
	"Yeah."
Iry
	"Well, we'll look around the town a bit more. Good luck."
Lucy
	"Yup. Thanks, come again."
---

Iry
	"Well... Let's go to Gen-san's place next."
Cliff
	"Gen-san?"
Iry
	"He's a carpenter. Our place is old, so..."
Iry
	"The floor gives out, and the bath is like it is..."
Iry
	"So I think he'll do a lot for us in the future."

---

Gen-san
	"Welcome! We'll do anything from reconstruction to repairs!"
Iry
	"You're energetic as always, Gen-san."
Gen-san
	"...Oh, Iry-Sensei. Do you have a leaking roof again?"
Iry
	"There's a lot of things I want fixed, but that's not why I came by today."
Iry
	"I came to introduce you to these two. They're Cliff-kun and Mena-chan."
Mena
	"Nice to meet you."
Cliff
	"Please give us your best regards."
Gen-san
	"Hey. My name's Gen. Please gimme your best regards."
Gen-san
	"Roof leaks, reconstruction, building additions, I can do it all! Just come to me any time."
Cliff
	"...Like the floor I fell through?"
Gen-san
	"Oh, that's not good. I'll go fix that for you later."
Iry
	"Oh. You don't have to do that. We can't pay for it for a while."
Gen-san
	"Don't worry about it. I'll do it for free this time as my introduction to these new people."
Iry
	"Really? That really helps us out."
Iry
	"But there're many more places that need to be fixed. So, Cliff-kun..."
Cliff
	"Y-Yes?"
Iry
	"Do your best to make some money, okay?"
Cliff
	"O-Okay..."
Gen-san
	"Haha. That's a big responsibility. Good luck, Cliff-boy."
Cliff
	"C-Cliff-boy...?"
Iry
	"Well, we'll be going now."
Mena
	"Good bye."
Gen-san
	"Thanks for coming!"
	
---

Iry
	"I've introduced you to Gen-san, so I'll show Mena-chan the bath now."
Mena
	"Bath?"
Iry
	"The Academy's not the only place that uses the hot spring."
Iry
	"This town has a public bath. The hot spring goes there as well and it's open to everybody in town."
	
---

Iry
	"...Huh? Manager? Manager!?"
Cliff
	"What's wrong?"
Iry
	"The manager isn't here. An old woman's usually at the counter."
Iry
	"...Hey, Cliff-kun!!"
Cliff
	"Y-Yes!? What is it!?"
Iry
	"This is the girl's bath! Get out right now!"
Cliff
	"W-What!? S-Sorry!"
	
---

Mena
	"Geez... You pervert."
Cliff
	"I'm sorry. I didn't know."
Iry
	"Thank goodness there weren't any customer. It would've been bad if there were anyone in here."
Mena
	"But it looks like there's only one bath here. Where's the men's bath?"
Iry
	"Oh, this bath is for girls only."
Cliff
	"W-What!? Then what about people like Will-Sensei and I?"
Iry
	"You'll have to make do with the bath at the Academy."
Cliff
	"That bath...?"
Iry
	"Well... you look like a girl, so you might be able to sneak in here."
Cliff
	"That's terrible."
Iry
	"Well, I'll stop joking now. Let's go to the library now."
Mena
	"Library? Is there one here?"
Cliff
	"Oh, Mena's happy."
Iry
	"Mena-chan, do you like books?"
Mena
	"Yes. I always read books when I have the time."
Iry
	"Wow, so you must study a lot."
Mena
	"T-That's not the case..."
	
---

Mena
	"Wow... there really are a lot of books!"
Cliff
	"Geez... she's getting hyped up."
Iry
	"Does Mena-chan like books to that degree?"
Cliff
	"Yes. She'd always go into our dad's study to read books."
Cliff
	"But... they were all taken away."
Iry
	"That might be the reason she's hyped up now."
Cliff
	"...Maybe."
Mena
	"This place is amazing. There's more books here than Dad's study!"
Iry
	"Of course there are. Even though this is a small town, it is a library after all."
Iry
	"But... you'd have to wait until next time to read books. We have more places to go."
Mena
	"Okay."
	
---

Iry
	"All that's left is... the pub and the church."
Cliff
	"Pub...?"
Iry
	"I'm not saying you should go drink there. Drinking isn't the only reason to go to a pub."
Iry
	"Information gathers where people are. Hard to find information might be found at the pub."
Cliff
	"Ah..."
Iry
	"And this town has only one pub. So people gather here, and it's crowded until late at night."
Iry
	"But you have to be careful, or a drunk will start messing with you."
Iry
	"...You should be careful, Cliff-kun. You look like people will mess with you."
Cliff
	"...I really look like I'm an easy target, don't I...?"
	
---

Hanna
	"Oh, welcome, Iry-Sensei."
Iry
	"Hello, Hanna-san. There isn't anybody here. Did we come before you opened up?"
Hanna
	"No, we just opened. Would you like something?"
Iry
	"No. I'm just showing the new people around town today."
Hanna
	"Oh... so they're new Hunters?"
Cliff
	"Nice to meet you. I'm Cliff Winston."
Mena
	"I'm Mena Winston. Nice to meet you."
Hanna
	"Oh, you two are siblings? Good luck. We can't do business unless you two work hard."
Cliff
	"...Huh?"
Hanna
	"Customers can't relax if monsters come out at night."
Cliff
	"Oh, I see."
Hanna
	"...With that said, the customers who can't go home early stay here, so we get lots of business as an inn."
Mena
	"Haha..."
Iry
	"So this place is crowded even late at night."
Hanna
	"But I think that's only because it's dangerous out."
Hanna
	"I wish the best of luck to you two, so we can have our peaceful town back."
Cliff
	"Thank you."
Mena
	"I'll do my best."
Hanna
	"So... Iry-Sensei, what will you do now?"
Iry
	"We'll go back to the Academy after going by the church. I think Sensei is waiting for us."
Hanna
	"I see. Come by again if you like."
Iry
	"Are you going to get me to walk drunkards home again? For free?"
Hanna
	"Come on. It's helping people out."
Cliff
	"Should I come by at night then?"
Mena
	"Oh, then I will too."
Hanna
	"Really? That'll really help me out."
Iry
	"Don't make promises without due consideration, you two. Protecting drunks is harder than you might think."
Cliff
	"Eh...?"
Iry
	"You have to fight your enemies while protecting the drunk person."
Iry
	"There's no guarantee that a monster won't attack the drunk person."
Iry
	"That person doesn't have a way to protect himself. All the more if they're drunk."
Iry
	"Can you take responsibility in that
Cliff
	"Oh..."
Mena
	"I-I'm sorry."
Iry
	"I won't tell you not to help out, but if you're going to help, be on guard and do your best, okay?"
Cliff
	"Okay."
Mena
	"I understand."
Hanna
	"Fufu. You two are reliable."
Iry
	"Well, I'll consider coming by tonight. But I'll have to leave for now."
Hanna
	"All right. I'll be waiting for your next visit."
	
---

Iry
	"Well... We can go home after we go by the church."
Cliff
	"There's a graveyard behind the church, huh?"
Iry
	"I wouldn't like it if that place was full of commotion instead of the pub."
Cliff
	"Haha..."
	
---

Aoi
	"Oh, Iry-Sensei. I appreciate your efforts."
Iry
	"You too, Aoi... good work."
Cliff
	"........."
Aoi
	"...What is it?"
Cliff
	"Oh... That is some unusual clothing you're wearing..."
Aoi
	"This is my uniform."
Cliff
	"Oh, I'm not saying it's strange or anything..."
Aoi
	"...I am sorry if I look strange."
Cliff
	"That's not what I meant..."
Mena
	"Um... What kind of a job are you doing here, Aoi-san?"
Aoi
	"As you can see, I am sweeping and cleaning most of the time."
Aoi
	"After this, I will go clean inside the building."
Mena
	"That sounds hard. Please do your best."
Aoi
	"You do not need to tell me."
Mena
	"Oh..."
Cliff
	"U-Um..."
Iry
	"Hey, Aoi. Don't be too blunt. They'll be living with you from now on."
Aoi
	"...I am sorry."
Cliff
	"Oh, no problem..."
Cliff
	"You're really polite, Aoi-san."
Aoi
	"......"
Aoi
	"Are you about to go back to the Academy, Sensei?"
Iry
	"That's what I plan on."
Aoi
	"I see... I passed by that arrogant real estate agent, so please be careful."
Iry
	"It should be fine. Sensei's at the Academy."
Cliff
	"Arrogant real estate agent?"
Iry
	"...Sensei told you earlier that there's someone targeting the Academy, right?"
Cliff
	"So that person is this real estate agent?"
Iry
	"Yup."
Iry
	"Thanks, Aoi. We'll be careful."
Iry
	"See you later."
Aoi
	"Please take care on your way home."
	
---

Iry
	"Well... that's everything."
Mena
	"Iry-Sensei, is it all right if I ask you a question?"
Iry
	"What is it, Mena-chan?"
Mena
	"You and Will-Sensei are married, right?"
Iry
	"Yes, that's right."
Mena
	"So why do you refer to Will-Sensei as Sensei?"
Iry
	"Hmm... I've been calling him like that for so long, so it's awkward to call him any other way now."
Cliff
	"A long time...?"
Iry
	"I was Sensei's student once. He didn't teach me Hunter stuff, but just history."
Cliff
	"Oh, really?"
Iry	
	"Yup. To put it simply, he made a move on his student."
Cliff
	"Made a move...?"
Mena
	"......"
Iry
	"Just kidding. It was actually me that made a move on him."
Iry
	"You too, Mena-chan. You should try your best if you find someone you like, okay?"
Mena
	"O-Okay..."
Cliff
	"C-Can we head back now?"
Iry
	"All right. I'm sure Sensei's getting hungry by now."

---


Iry
	"We're back..."
???
	"Oh, madam. Welcome home."
Iry
	"...Who were you again?"
???
	"...Madam, your jokes are pretty harsh. I believe I've introduced myself already."
Iry
	"I tend to forget things I don't need to remember."
???
	"...Then let me introduce myself again."
Benjamin
	"...I am Benjamin, a real estate agent. Please give me your best regards."
Iry
	"Sorry. I don't think I can keep it in my head until tomorrow."
Benjamin
	"Guhhh......"
Cliff
	They don't appear to be on friendly terms...
Benjamin
	"...I will come by again some other time."
Benjamin
	"Servant! We're going!"
Servant
	"Oh, wait up, Benjamin-sama!"
	
---

Iry
	"Heh. Don't come back!"
Mena
	"Um... Is that person...?"
Iry
	"...Yup. He's the one talking nonsense about buying all the land around here to make a resort."
Iry
	"It's useless no matter how many times he comes. I won't give him this place no matter what!"
Cliff
	"Oh..."
Iry
	"This isn't the time to look stupid like that, Cliff-kun."
Iry
	"If he takes the Academy, it means you won't have a place to live."
Cliff
	"T-That would be a problem!"
Iry
	"Then you should work hard so he won't beat us."
Mena
	"Yes... I know."
Iry
	"Well, we'll be working hard starting tomorrow..."
Iry
	"For now, let's have a welcome party after Lucy and Aoi come home."
Cliff
	"Huh? That's fine, you don't have to cater for us like that."
Iry
	"It's okay. The beginning is always important."
Iry
	"We're going to be living together from now on, so you want to get to know each other, right?"
Cliff
	"Well, I guess..."
Iry
	"Then it's decided. I have to go tell Sensei about it."
	
And my new life starts... ...Or so it seemed. But... it would turn out to be full of chaos, and be far away from what one would call a peaceful life...
