    show haruka cook neutral with dissolve
    ha "Do you cook a lot, Saionji-san?"

    ri "Sure. Go ahead."
    
    show haruka cook neutral with dissolve
    ha "First, you need to cook the rice."
    "Haruka showed me a row of rice cookers to the side of the room."
    ha "First, you have to measure out the rice in this cup. One cup is one serving. Next, you rinse the rice with water a couple of times, then you add water up to the appropriate line on the rice bowl."
    ri "Yeah. Sounds pretty easy so far."
    ha "Since we'll be making two servings today, we'll just add two cups and add water up to the line for two servings."
    "Haruka then put the rice bowl into the cooker and turned it on."
    ha "Now, let's make some tamagoyaki."
    "She got out a package of butter, some salt and sugar, a carton of milk, and a carton of eggs from a grocery bag."
    ha "First, you crack two eggs in a bowl. You have to be careful not to get the shell into the bowl with the yolk."
    "Haruka demonstrated by cracking a pair of eggs."
    ri "Like this?"
    "I tried to do the same, but because I was a little bit nervous, a shell fragment accidentally got into the bowl."
    
    show haruka cook smile with dissolve
    ha "Uhn. Like that."
    "She continued to smile and discretely picked the shell out with a chopstick."
    
    show haruka cook neutral with dissolve
    ha "Now, you add milk until it's approximately twice its original size. Then, you add a little bit of salt and sugar."
    ri "How much should I add?"
    ha "Ummm... I guess it kind of depends on your preference. I add about a teaspoon of salt and three teaspoons of sugar."
    ha "After you've done that, you just mix everything together."
    "I spun the contents of the bowl with a pair of chopsticks, until it turned into a solid light yellow batter."
    ha "Now, you melt a little bit of butter on the frying pan so that it doesn't stick, and then you pour it in."
    "Haruka turned on the stove and melted a spoon of butter on it."
    "She then poured her bowl of batter into the pan."
    "I did the same."
    
    show haruka cook smile with dissolve
    ha "Uhn, just like that."
    
    show haruka cook neutral with dissolve    
    ha "When you're doing this at home, it's generally not a good idea to use a frying pan that's too big, or else the batter will spread out too thin and it'll be hard to fold it."
    ri "I see..."
    ha "Now, while the batter is still kind of raw, you fold it a couple of times using the spatula."
    ha "Mmm... I guess this part's a little bit tricky. You have to make sure that the bottom's solid, while the top's still uncooked."
    "Haruka demonstrated by slipping her spatula underneath her batter and neatly folding it four times."
    "This looked a little bit difficult. I tried the same, but I ended up tearing the bottom of the batter."
    
    show haruka cook handsbehind forcedsmile with dissolve
    ha "It's kind of difficult because the solid bottom's kind of thin..."
    "I tried to fold it again, but now, the batter was already entirely solid."

    show haruka cook neutral with dissolve

    "Haruka demonstrated by taking the folded egg out and cutting it into about ten neat strips."
    
    show haruka cook smile with dissolve
    ha "To make everything look nice, you throw the sides out. Eh-heh, I always eat them so that I can see if they turned out okay."
    "Since mine wasn't folded entirely right, they kind of fell apart as I tried to cut them."
    "In the end, Haruka presented me with ten perfectly made tamago, while I presented her with some scrambled eggs."
    
    show haruka cook handraised smile with dissolve
    ha "Eh-heh. Don't worry, Saionji-san. You'll get better soon."
    
    show haruka cook neutral with dissolve
    ha "Now, we need to make some stir fried vegetables."
    "Haruka put away the ingredients for the tamagoyaki and got out some vegetable oil, a carrot, some asparagus, an onion, a package of mini sausages, and a bottle of soy sauce."
    ha "After you wash the vegetables, you peel the carrot and cut them into round slips."
    "I tried to imitate her, although though my carrot slips weren't as neat as hers."
    
    show haruka cook smile with dissolve
    ha "Eh-heh, I don't really like eating the stem of the asparagus, so I cut most of them out when I make mine."
    ri "Yeah, I don't really like them either..."
    ha "But then, I always feel guilty about throwing them out, so I end up using them for decoration."
    
    show haruka cook neutral with dissolve
    ha "Now, you just have to cut the top and the bottom off the onion and then peel the outer skin off."
    ha "After that, I slice the onion horizontally into some circular slips. The \'o\' shape they make once you separate the layers looks interesting, don't you think?"
    ri "Uhn. Let's do that."
    "Soon, we had a pile of sliced carrots, onion rings, and asparagus."
    ha "The sausages are easy to prepare. You just take them and you make a small cross with your knife on the bottom."
    
    show haruka cook smile with dissolve
    ha "That way, when the meat expands in the heat, they make that cute octopus shape."
    "Even though it sounded pretty easy, my sausages looked nowhere as neat as Haruka's."
    
    show haruka cook neutral with dissolve
    ha "Now, I think we're ready to stir fry this."
    ha "You add all the vegetables into the frying pan and add some vegetable oil. Like this."
    "The pan sizzled as Haruka added the oil and stirred the vegetables with the spatula."
    ha "While it's cooking, I think it tastes better if you also add some soy sauce."
    "I followed her instructions and made some reasonably good looking stir fry."
    ha "You can also add some salt to your taste. Some people also like adding ground chili peppers too."
    ri "I see... But Haruka-san's not adding any?"
    
    show haruka cook onehandraised forcedsmile with dissolve
    ha "Eh-heh... Spicy food's just a little..."
    "I decided to just add a little bit of salt."

    show haruka cook happy with dissolve
    ha "And that's it for the sides."
    "A bit later, the rice finished cooking."
    "Haruka opened the rice and mixed it with a rice scoop."
    
    show haruka cook neutral with dissolve
    ha "You have to make sure the rice is mixed after you open the lid, or else you won't be able to eat it later."
    "After slipping her hands into a pair of oven mittens, she grabbed the rice bowl and brought it to our station."
    ha "Now, all we have to do is put all of the food into the bento box and decorate it."
    "Haruka neatly tucked in the rice into the biggest section of the box."
    ha "Mmm... The rice looks nice with some sesame seeds on top."
    ha "And of course, we can't forget the red dried plum at the middle."
    "She brought out more ingredients."
    "We put the finishing touches on our bento boxes."
    "As she said earlier, Haruka used the asparagus stems to make a little wall between the tamago and the vegetables."
    "I should do the same. Well, in my case, I suppose it'd be the scrambled eggs and the vegetables..."
