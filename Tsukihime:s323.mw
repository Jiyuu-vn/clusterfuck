` Because there's no one that I know outside.@ Everyone hates me outside.@

`"That's not true.@ Everyone wants to like you, Shiki-kun."@
br
` Yes.@ I knew that, but I couldn't believe it.@ Because my father went outside, and---\

` He was torn to pieces.\

` Yeah, that's why I will always stay here.@ I don't want any more scary things happening.@
br
`"But, you will just be by yourself all the time.@ Being by yourself is no fun."@
br
` Even if it's no fun, it is better than being scared.\

`"That's, that's not fun at all.@ Then, Shiki-chan, you can believe in me."@

`"It's okay!@ Shiki-chan, you can trust me and come out!"@
