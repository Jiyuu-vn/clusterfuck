Cliff
	"Oh... a visitor?"
Benjamin
	"Oh, hello. How are you doing today?"
Benjamin
	"I have brought you some pleasing news today."
Cliff
	"Oh, really? Thank you very much."
Benjamin
	"......Who in the hell are you?"
Cliff
	"Well... I'm a newcomer to this Academy."
Benjamin
	"O-Oh. Excuse me. Will you allow me to talk to Will-Sensei?"
Cliff
	"Oh, okay. Please hold o-"
Lucy
	"You moron!!!"
Cliff
	"Ouchyy... What are you doing, Lucy...?"
Lucy
	"That's my line! I came back 'cause I had a bad feeling... but, what the hell are you doing!?"
Cliff
	"I'm only taking the guest and..."
Lucy
	"Guest!? This guy!? Don't be stupid! What are you inviting him in for!?"
Benjamin
	"...How terrible of you."
Cliff
	"Yeah. It seems this person brought good news for us today..."
Lucy
	"Don't take him seriously! I'm sure it's about getting several hundred thousand Zel if we abandon the Academy now!"
Benjamin
	"No, no, no. You have the digits wrong. The worth of the land here has finally gone over a million Zel now!"
Cliff
	"Wow, that's awesome."
Lucy
	"Don't respond to him! It's meaningless!"
Benjamin
	"It is time to make this place into one big recreational area. If we do that, this place will surely..."
Lucy
	"Don't be ridiculous! We won't give you the Academy no matter what!!"
Benjamin
	"Please do not get angry and consider this proposal..."
Lucy
	"I'll come up with the same conclusion no matter how much I think! Just get outta here!"
Benjamin
	"Fine... I shall return again."
Lucy
	"Don't come back! Bring me some salt to purify this place, Ku-chan!!"
Cliff
	"U-Uhh..."
Lucy
	"You got it, Ku-chan!? You can't have him enter the Academy ever again!"
Lucy
	"Got it!?"
Cliff
	"O-Okay..."
	
After that, Lucy flies back to her work again.
After that, Lucy walks back into the Academy...

Benjamin
	"Oh, hello. We meet again."
Cliff
	"Oh, hello."
Benjamin
	"Well... I brought you some news today."
Cliff
	"What kind of a news is it?"
Benjamin
	"It is an estimate of the income and expenditures if we make this place into a resort. See..."
Cliff
	"Um... I'm sorry. I'm not quite sure what you're talking about."
Benjamin
	"W-Well... This shows how much we can make if we turn this land into a resort."
Cliff
	"Oh, I see."
Benjamin
	"Even with a rough estimate, we can at least see a profit of 1.5 million. Can you let go of such a good deal?"
Cliff
	"Well... Um, so why did you tell me this?"
Benjamin
	"Well, because you're from the Academy."
Cliff
	"...Oh."
Benjamin
	"...We need your land to make this  resort! Do you understand!?"
Cliff
	"W-Well... then..."
Benjamin
	"Then?"
Cliff
	"...I guess you would have to give up on that idea."
Benjamin
	"Youuuu!! Are you mocking me!?"
Cliff
	"Whoa!"
Benjamin-san follows me around for a while after that.

Benjamin
	"........."
Cliff
	"Oh... hi."
Benjamin
	"...You're no good. Go get the Academy President."
Cliff
	"Um... Will-Sensei is gone right now..."
Benjamin
	"I don't care. I'll wait until he comes back."
Cliff
	"Oh..."
Will
	"It'll be a bother if you do that."
Benjamin
	"Oh, hello, Will-Sensei. I have been waiting for you."
Will
	"Then I'll be going now. Take care of the rest, Cliff-kun."
Benjamin
	"H-Hold on! I have some important matter to..."
Will
	"If it's about the sale of the Academy, I have entrusted everything about it to Cliff-kun."
Cliff
	"W-What!?"
Benjamin
	"W-What!?"
Will
	"So if Cliff-kun gives you an okay, I can accept your offer."
Benjamin
	"I-I certainly heard those words!"
Benjamin
	"Well, Cliff-Sensei. Please! You only need to say that you will give up his land!"
Cliff
	"N-No!"
Benjamin
	"Please!"
Cliff
	"No!"
Benjamin
	"Come on!"
Cliff
	"I can't!"
Benjamin
	"Cliff-Sensei!"
	
Benjamin
	"Please, Cliff-Sensei!"
Cliff
	"I refuse!"
Benjamin
	"Please!"
Iry
	"You're mean, Sensei..."
Cliff
	"Whoa!? Benjamin-san!?"
Benjamin
	"I found you, Cliff-Sensei! Please say that you will give me the land..."
Cliff
	"I won't!"
Benjamin
	"Oh, hold on! ... I mean, please wait Cliff-Sensei!"
	
I manage to escape Benjamin-san.

Iry
	"Cliff-kun."
Cliff
	"Oh... Iry-Sensei."
Iry
	"It seems you're working hard. Did you find a job?"
Cliff
	"Well... um..."
Iry
	"Please keep trying. We're counting on you."
Cliff
	"Oh, yes. I'll try my best."
Cliff
	I wonder what they're usually doing...
Will
	"Hey, Cliff-kun. It seems you're getting used to living here."
Cliff
	"Oh... Will-Sensei. Are you going somewhere?"
Will
	"I'm going to a Hunter Guild meeting. I'll be back by dinnertime."
Cliff
	"Okay... have a safe trip."

Gen-san
	"Hey, Cliff-boy."
Cliff
	"Oh... Gen-san. Hello."
Cliff
	"Do you need something?"
Gen-san
	"Well, it's about the Academy building."
Cliff
	"Okay..."
Gen-san
	"...The crappiness of this building is motivating my carpenter passion."
Cliff
	"Oh."
Gen-san
	"So please bring me a job soon, okay? I'll fix it with all my heart."
Cliff
	"Oh... okay. Thank you for coming here."

Cliff
	"Oh...? Hanna-san...?"
Hanna
	"Oh, Cliff-kun... great timing. Is Will-Sensei here?"
Cliff
	"Um... I think he's gone at this time of the day."
Hanna
	"I guess it can't be helped... then can you give this to Will-Sensei?"
	
Hanna-san hand me an envelope.

Cliff
	"Oh, okay."
Hanna
	"I'm counting on you, bye."
Cliff
	"...I wonder what this is...?"
Cliff
	"It's a bill for Will-Sensei drinking..."
	
There's a strange guest at the Academy when I get back.

Benjamin
	"Hello, long time no see."
Cliff
	"Um... well..."
Cliff
	"Was it Beja-san?"
Benjamin
	"It's Benjamin!"
???
	"...Hah!"
Benjamin
	"Don't laugh, Servant!"
Servant
	"I-I'm sorry, Benjamin-sama!"
Benjamin
	"Well, anyway... is Will-Sensei here?"
Cliff
	"He's not here."
Benjamin
	"I don't want you to lie. He should be here at this time of the day."
Benjamin
	"First of all, how do you know he isn't here when you just came home right now?"
Benjamin
	"Hah... this is a perfect reasoning."
Cliff
	"...Sensei left for Liguria the other day."
Benjamin
	"........."
Benjamin
	"Excuse me!?"
Cliff
	"So... I will be the Substitute Academy President for a while."
Benjamin
	"A kid like you... I mean, somebody as young as you are?"
Cliff
	"...Yes."
Benjamin
	"I see. Then I can come to you regarding the sale of the land. Am I correct?"
Cliff
	"U-Um... I should warn you, but you should give up on this land."
Benjamin
	"...Warn me? What do you mean?"
Cliff
	"...This place is haunted."
Benjamin
	"...I will not fall for such childish tricks."
Cliff
	"It's true! So you should give up on this land!"
Benjamin
	"Oh, hold on!"
Benjamin
	"Damn... he got away. What a petty brat."
Benjamin
	"...Ghost? Even a kid won't believe such a story."
Benjamin
	"...A ghost, huh?"
Benjamin
	"Hey, Servant."
Servant
	"...What is it?"
Benjamin
	"Don't you think we can use this?"
Servant
	"Oh... Benjamin-sama is at it again..."

Aoi
	"Oh, welcome back."
Cliff
	"I'm home... oh, you're spraying water."
	
Aoi-san is sprinkling water around using a foot pump and a hose connected to the well.

Cliff
	"That looks tiring. Do you want me to do it?"
Aoi
	"No... It is fine. This is part of training as well."
	
...So something like this can be a training too?

Aoi
	"This trains my legs."
Cliff
	"I see."
	
But... she should take it easy on things like sprinkling water.

I find Kitty at the Academy entrance.

Kitty
	"Cliff."
Cliff
	"Oh, Kitty."
Cliff
	"Hey... isn't that appearance bad?"
Kitty
	"Bad?"
Cliff
	"Yeah... it's showing off that you're a monster. You should look more human..."
Kitty
	"All right. Then I'll wear this"
	
...It looks as if Kitty disappeared for a second.
In the next instant, there's a human girl standing there.

Kitty
	"Is this fine?"
Cliff
	"Wow, you can do that kind of a thing? Yeah, that looks better."
Kitty
	"Hehe."
	
Kitty looks proud.

Cliff
	"I wonder what Kitty's doing."
	
I'm a bit curious, so I go back to the Academy.

Cliff
	"Hey Kitty... where... oh."
Kitty
	"Zzz..."
Cliff
	"Oh... she's taking a nap."
	
...It's cute how she's holding onto the pillow. I wonder if Mena gave her that?

Cliff
	"Geez... you'll catch a cold like that."
	
I put a blanket on her and go back outside.

Kitty
	"Cliff. A weird guy came by."
Cliff
	"Weird guy?"
Kitty
	"Yeah... a shiny mustache guy and a large guy with a line for his eyes."
	
Oh... it's Benjamin-san.

Kitty
	"They went home after I told them no one was here."
Cliff
	"...I see. Thanks for watching the Academy."
Kitty
	"Hehe."

Kitty
	"Oh, Cliff. They came by again today."
Cliff
	"Really? What were they saying?"
Kitty
	"Nothing... just that they'll come back again."
Cliff
	"I see. Thanks."
Kitty
	"Hehe."
	
She must be really happy about being helpful.

Cliff
	"Oh, Kitty."

Kitty's sitting on the porch upstairs, dangling her legs.

Cliff
	"Hey, Kitty. Watch out, you might fall."
Kitty
	"It's fine. I can fly."
	
Oh... right.

Cliff
	"What're you doing there?"
Kitty
	"I'm watching the sunset. It's really pretty."
Cliff
	"Oh, you're right."
	
...Well, a sunset is something I see all the time...

Kitty
	"I've been trapped for a long time... so I haven't seen something like this."
Cliff
	"Oh..."
	
Right... I guess even a casual thing like this looks really new for Kitty.

Kitty
	"Cliff. You wanna come watch it with me?"
Cliff
	"Yeah."
	
I'll go up there too.
We watch the sunset together on the porch.
...I was a bit scared of falling, though.

Aoi
	"Oh, Cliff-san... welcome back."
Cliff
	"Oh... you're sprinkling water again."
Aoi
	"Yes... it is getting really dusty out here."
	
Aoi-san is pumping the water out by pushing on the pedal at her feet.

Lucy
	"I'm home... oh, you're spraying water around?"
Aoi
	"Oh, welcome home, Lucy-san."
Lucy
	"But... isn't it a bit tedious using a small pump like that?"
Cliff
	"I think so too."
Aoi
	"No, it allows me to train my legs."
	
Aoi-san sure is diligent...

Lucy
	"Hey, Ku-chan. I think I saw something called a Spiritual pump over at Gen-san's place."
Cliff
	"Spiritual... pump?"
Lucy
	"I guess pumping water becomes real easy if you use that."
Cliff
	"Oh... There's such a thing?"
	
I guess I'll go ask him about it tomorrow.

Aoi
	"Welcome home, Cliff-san."
Cliff
	"Oh, thanks for your work, Aoi-san."
Aoi
	"No problem."
	
When I return home, Aoi-san is pulling out the hose to sprinkle the ground.

Cliff
	"Oh, are you about to water the area?"
Aoi
	"Yes... I heard that you have got a new pump?"
Cliff
	"Yeah, you only have to press it lightly and water comes out."
Aoi
	"I see... I shall try."
	
Aoi-san steps hard on the pump. Then...

Aoi
	"Kya!!"
	
Water gushes out from the hose and soaks me and Aoi-san...

Aoi
	"I-I'm sorry, Cliff-san..."
Cliff
	"You pressed too hard, Aoi-san."
Aoi
	"I guess so... I pushed hard like I was used to."
	
Aoi-san is on the ground, soaked wet. I can see through her clothes since they're wet.

Cliff
	*A-Aoi-san doesn't wear a bra...?*
	
Aoi
	"Excuse me... I'm going to go change."
Cliff
	"Y-Yeah... you might catch a cold if you don't go dry off."
Aoi
	"I believe you should go change as well."
Cliff
	"Y-Yeah... I'll do that."
	
Aoi-san goes in the Academy.

Cliff
	*My heart's still pounding...*
	
	
Kitty
	"Oh, welcome back, Cliff."
	
Kitty comes down from the porch.

Cliff
	"K-Kitty! Your wings!"
Kitty
	"Oh, oops."
Kitty
	"There."
Cliff
	"Phew... Don't show your wings in front of people, okay?"
Kitty
	"All right."

Kitty
	"Cliff!"
Kitty's calling me from somewhere.

Kitty
	"Hey!"
Cliff
	"Oh, Kitty, what are you doing there?"
Kitty
	"Hanging laundry!"
Cliff
	"You're helping out? That's great. Good job."
Kitty
	"Thanks."
	
Kitty's working hard to find her place here.

Kitty
	"That's weird... I can't find it."
Cliff
	"Kitty... what are you doing?"
Kitty
	"Oh, Cliff... I dropped a laundry."
Cliff
	"...You can't find it?"
Kitty
	"No..."
Cliff
	"All right. I'll look for it too."
Kitty
	"Really? Thanks."
	
I look for the laundry with her.

Cliff
	"Um... Is that it?"
	
I find it quite easily. It's hanging on a high branch. I guess that's hard to find from Kitty's view.

Cliff
	"Oh... This is..."
	
...It's someone's underwear. Is it Mena's? Or Aoi-san's? Could it be Sheryl's...?

Kitty
	"Oh, Cliff. Did you find it?"
Cliff
	"Yeah. Is this it?"
Kitty
	"Yeah. Thanks!"
	
Kitty runs inside.

Cliff
	"Girl's underwear sure is small..."
Kitty
	"Cliff..."
Cliff
	"W-What happened, Kitty?"
Kitty's covered in mud.

Kitty
	"Wind took the laundry when I was hanging it..."
Kitty
	"I fell when I was going after it..."
To sum it up... I guess she fell from the porch trying to go after the laundry taken by the wind.

Cliff
	"Are you all right?"
Kitty
	"Yeah... I'm fine."
Cliff
	"But that's weird that you fell."
Kitty
	"Weird?"
Cliff
	"You can fly... right?"
Kitty
	"But... I'm not supposed to use my wings..."
Cliff
	"Oh... I see."
I'm just glad she isn't hurt.

Cliff
	"Anyway... you should go take a bath and wash yourself off."
Kitty
	"Yeah... I'll do that..."
Kitty
	"Oh yeah! You can join me!"
Cliff
	"Huh!?"
Kitty
	"Let's go! Come on!"
Cliff
	"A-All right. Don't pull me."
Kitty
	"Bath with Cliff, bath with Cliff!"
Cliff
	"Now, now...Don't play around. Come here, I'll wash you."
Kitty
	"All right."
Cliff
	*Man... I guess being too innocent is also a problem...*

Kitty
	"Oh... Cliff."
Even the always-sleepy Kitty looks prepared.

Kitty
	"I'm ready anytime."
Cliff
	"Yeah... I know."
	
I'm back at the Academy.
Sheryl
	"Oh, Cliff-san."
Cliff
	"Oh... It's Sheryl's voice."
Sheryl
	"Welcome home."
Sheryl's calling me from the porch.
Cliff
	"Oh... I'm home, Sheryl."
Sheryl
	"I'm coming down right now."
Cliff
	"Huh!?"
Sheryl
	"Here I go."
Cliff
	"H-Hey!!"
Sheryl
	"Oh... ohh?"
Cliff
	"Ouu... Don't be too rash, Sheryl..."
Sheryl
	"S-Sorry... It's just a habit from when I was a ghost..."
Cliff
	"This habit's dangerous, so you should get rid of it quickly..."
Sheryl
	"Y-Yes... I'll try..."
Sheryl's on my face. She's heavy, but soft... and it smells good and...
Cliff
	"By the way..."
Sheryl
	"Y-Yes...?"
Cliff
	"Um... If you could get off of me..."
Sheryl
	"Oh, sorry. I didn't notice."
That was close... I would've felt funny if she was on me any longer.

Kitty
	"Oh... Cliff..."
Cliff
	"...You look sleepy, Kitty."
Kitty
	"Yeah... I'm going to go take a nap..."
Kitty goes back inside.

I'm back at the Academy.
...It seems everyone's gone.
