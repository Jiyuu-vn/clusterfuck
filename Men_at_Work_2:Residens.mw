Cliff
	"Hello."
Benjamin
	"...Oh, it's the kid from the Academy. What do you want?"
Cliff
	"Um... I want to talk to Wisor-san."
Benjamin
	"With Wisor-Sensei? What do you need to talk to him about?"
Cliff
	"It's about the old castle."
Benjamin
	"........"
Benjamin
	"Hold on. Leave right after you're done talking to him, okay?"
Cliff
	*...I guess he still hates me...*
Wisor
	"Hello. So you found something out about that old castle?"
Cliff
	"Oh, hello."
Wisor
	"So you actually went to that old castle? I'm sure there were lots of powerful monsters."
Cliff
	"Well, it's more like we were there when we noticed."
Wisor
	"?"
Cliff
	"We went to the sewers for this other job, but..."
Cliff
	"We found out that it's connected to the basement of the old castle."
Wisor
	"Oh, so you can enter the basement from the sewers?"
Wisor
	"I knew the castle had a basement, but I could not figure out the way to get in there."
Wisor
	"Thank you. This is valuable information."
Cliff
	"I'm glad to be of help."
Cliff
	"Please be careful if you're going to the castle. I met a strange monster there."
Wisor
	"A strange monster...?"
Cliff
	"He called himself Drakul. The one said to be a vampire..."
Wisor
	"Oh. If that's true, I would like to hear stories from that monster."
Cliff
	"P-Please don't say such scary things!"
Wisor
	"I'm just joking. I shall be careful."
Wisor
	"Thank you for the valuable information. Please drop by if you find anything again."
Cliff
	"Okay. Then I'll be going now."
Wisor
	"Okay. Good bye."
	
Benjamin
	"...Did they go home? Heh."
Wisor
	"I guess it is about time..."
Benjamin
	"?"
...It's a big mansion. I wish this place was our Academy.
