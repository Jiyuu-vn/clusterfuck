Iry
	"Oh, Cliff-kun... Are you working hard?"
Cliff
	"I-Iry-Sensei."
Iry
	"...You want to join me for some tea? I'll treat you."
Cliff
	"Oh... no thank you."
Cliff
	"Um, I can't be resting while everyone else is working hard."
Iry
	"So I'm the only one resting, huh...?"
Cliff
	"N-No. I didn't mean it like that...!!"
Iry
	"I'm joking. I'm not sitting around like this for nothing, you know?"
Iry
	"...Information gathers where people gather. I'm waiting here for good information."
Iry
	"The tea is just a subsequent thing."
Cliff
	"Subsequent, huh?"
Iry
	"...Do you want to say something?"
Cliff
	"...Information gathers where there are people, right?"
Iry
	"......That's right."
Cliff
	"But you're the only one here right now."
Iry
	"...There are days like that."
Cliff
	"I see."
If she says so, it must be true.
Iry
	"Hey, Cliff-kun."
Cliff
	"Oh, Iry-Sensei."
Iry
	"You seem to be working hard."
Cliff
	"Yeah..."
Cliff
	"But... it's hard to find something that might be a job for us."
Iry
	"Patience is the key to this job. You just need to go to different places and collect information."
Cliff
	"Yes. I'll do my best."
---	

Iry
	"Cliff-kun... Were you able to make friends with Lucy and Aoi?"
Cliff
	"Well... I don't think it's much of a problem since Lucy-san's so openhearted."
Cliff
	"But Aoi-san is..."
Iry
	"Well, it's no wonder considering how you guys first met."
Cliff
	"I didn't do it on purpose."
Iry
	"But you saw it, right?"
Cliff
	"I couldn't tell."
Iry
	"Well, I don't think Aoi's really mad."
Iry
	"I think time'll solve this problem if you show sincerity."
Cliff
	"Yes... I'll do my best."
---
	
Iry
	"Hey, Cliff-kun."
Cliff
	"Oh. Hi."
Iry-Sensei is drinking tea at the Cafe Terrace again.
Iry
	"Master!! Make me another blueberry waffle!"
Is she really collecting information?

Mena
	"Welcome."
Cliff
	"...Looks like you're working hard."
Mena
	"Yeah. It's a job I finally found. I have to work hard so I won't get fired."
Cliff
	"Haha."
Mena
	"So... what would you like?"
Cliff
	"Oh, I'll take the waffle set."
Mena
	"All right. Please wait a bit."
Mena goes inside and brings me some waffles.
...It's just made and it's really good.

---

Mena
	"Welcome."
Mena's working hard at the Cafe.
...I think the clean-looking uniform suits her.
Mena
	"What would you like?"
Cliff
	"Um, I'll take a cold lemon tea."
Mena
	"All right."
Mena goes inside after taking my order.

---

Mena
	"Oh, Cliff. Welcome."
I think there are many more customers here now.
And it's guys too...
..........
Mena
	"What would you like?"
Cliff
	"Um... Iced coffee."
...Is it just me, or do I feel some cold stares when I talk to Mena like this?

---

Mena
	"Welcome... oh, Cliff."
Cliff
	"You look busy."
Mena
	"Yeah."
Mena
	"Oh... right away!"
A customer calls out for her and Mena runs to another table.
I can't be bothering her, so I exit the Cafe.

---

Mena
	"I was so surprised, Cliff. I didn't know a ghost like Sheryl-san existed."
Cliff
	"Yeah... really."
I think she's a really special case, though.
Mena
	"I'm not scared of ghosts now thanks to Sheryl-san."
Cliff
	"Yeah... me too."
Mena
	"...You don't have to worry about me asking you to sleep with me again."
Cliff
	"Haha..."
That's a bit lonely for me... I guess?

---

Mena
	"Hey Cliff... Is there anything that even a ghost can eat?"
Cliff
	"U-Um..."
Cliff
	"I think it's fundamentally impossible."
Mena
	"You think so?"
Mena
	"Why is Sheryl-san a ghost?"
Cliff
	"...She might have some lingering affection for this world."
Mena
	"...Does she look like she does?"
Cliff
	"Nope."
Really... why is she a ghost?

---

Mena
	"Hey Cliff. What do you think Sensei is doing right now?"
Cliff
	"Well... it seemed like they were taking on a dangerous job."
Mena
	"Yeah... I wonder if they're all right."
But they can even defeat three-headed dragons, so I don't think they'll lose easily.
Cliff
	"It's all right. They're strong."
Mena
	"...You're right."
	
---
	
Mena
	"Oh... Welcome, Cliff."
Cliff
	"You guys seem busy."
Mena
	"Yeah. We're busy since we're getting more customers."
Mena
	"So... what would you like?"
Cliff
	"Um... I just came to see how you were doing."
Mena
	"...Please stop since that's causing trouble for the other customers."
Cliff
	"...I'll take iced coffee."
Mena
	"Okay, please wait a bit."
I think Mena's getting wise in business...

---

The Cafe Terrasse is crowded today as usual.
Mena
	"Oh, Cliff. Welcome."
Cliff
	"Um... I'll take the sandwich set."
Mena
	"Oh... you're hungry?"
Cliff
	"Yeah."
Mena
	"All right, hold on for a bit."
Mena goes to the back and brings out fresh sandwiches.
Mena
	"Thanks for waiting."
Cliff
	"Oh, thanks..."
Cliff
	"Huh...? Did the boiled egg come with this set?"
Mena
	"That's a bonus from the master. He says it's because you're helping him out often."
Cliff
	"Oh, I'm glad. Thanks."
I feel like today's a good day for me.

---

There's a group of about 10 people sitting at the large table.
"Sandwich" "OJ" "Milk" "Blended coffee" "Same" "Special" "Coco" "Choco-parfait" "Meat sauce" "Iced"
Mena
	"Please wait."
Is Mena going to the back to get pen and paper?
No... she's out with a bunch of stuff!
Mena
	"Thanks for waiting. Ham sandwich, orange juice, hot milk, 2 blended coffee, daily special..."
Mena
	"Coco, chocolate parfait, meat sauce, and iced coffee."
Wow. The group claps. I guess she's right.
Cliff
ЃiMena sure is amazing...Ѓj

---

Mena
	"Oh, welcome."
Cliff
	"You have blueberry waffles?"
Mena
	"Oh... sorry, it's sold out."
Cliff
	"Oh, that's too bad. Then I'll take banana cream."
Mena
	"Sorry, we can't make waffles. The iron plate's broken."
Cliff
	"Oh, really?"
It looks like today would be a bad day for me.

---

Cliff
	"Hey, Mena..."
Mena
	"What?"
Cliff
	"Did the master give you that uniform?"
Mena
	"No, Hanna-san gave it to me."
Cliff
	"Hanna-san?"
Mena
	"Yeah. This is what she wore when she was a waitress."
Cliff
	"...Wow, so she wore that before?"
It certainly would look good on Hanna-san.
Cliff
	"I'm just wondering, but..."
Mena
	"What?"
Cliff
	"Why did Hanna-san have such a uniform?"
Mena
	"I told you she was a waitress before..."
Cliff
	"Don't you usually give the uniform back to the store when you quit?"
Mena
	"You're right."
Hanna-san sure is a mystery....

---

Mena
	"Oh, hold on a bit. I'll clean this up right away."
Mena takes all the plates to the counter.
The plates are on the counter right now...
Cliff
	"Hey... whose job is it to wash the dishes?"
Mena
	"Eh? It's the master's job."
Oh!! The plates on the counter has disappeared the instant I took my eyes off of them.
Cliff
	"Master's here today?"
Mena
	"Come on. He's always here."
Cliff
	"Really...?"
Mena
	"Oh, I have to go put the plates back."
...Looking, I see that the plates are on the counter all clean.
Mena puts them back in the cupboard.

---

Cliff
	"...I couldn't see the master again..."
Mena
	"......?"
Cliff
	"Um... I've never seen the master."
Mena
	"What? Really?"
Cliff
	"...Yeah."
I haven't seen him at all.
Mena
	"That's rare. I thought everyone knew him."
Cliff
	"But the master never comes out in front of people."
Mena
	"You make it sound like he's a rare monster or something."
I think the rare monster would be much easier to find than the master.

---

Mena
	"Oh... Cliff."
Mena
	"I can go anytime."
Cliff
	"All right. I'll come get you when we go."
Mena
	"Thanks."
Mena looks busy.
...I shouldn't bother her.

---

The Cafe Terrace is pretty crowded.
I don't see anybody I know.

---

Mena
	"Oh... Cliff."
Cliff
	"What are you doing, Mena?"
Mena
	"Just thinking..."
Mena
	"I'm thinking that maybe I should work during the day like Lucy-san and Aoi-san. But..."
Mena
	"I can't find the right job..."
Saying so, Mena stirs the ice in her cup.
Mena
	"I'll try hard to find a job, so..."
Mena
	"Please work hard and go find us a job, okay?"
Cliff
	"Yeah, I'll do my best."

---	
	
Mena
	"Oh... Cliff."
Cliff
	"What are you doing, Mena?"
Mena
	"Haha... Iry-Sensei said the waffles here are good, so..."
There's a waffle with lots of blueberry sauce on the table. It certainly does look good.
Mena
	"Oh yeah, master was thanking us for getting rid of the mice."
Mena
	"He said you can come to him when you need help."
Cliff
	"Oh, really? I'm glad."
I want to get some waffle too, so I sit down with Mena.
Cliff
	"Excuse me. I'll take the waffle set as well!"
I also wanted to meet the master that I've never met, but...
.........
There's no reply.
Cliff
	"Is the master not here?"
Mena
	"...Master is really shy, so..."
...How would he take orders like that?
...When I think so, I hear a sound from the counter.
Mena
	"Oh, I guess it's done."
...Looking, I see waffles and a drink on the counter.
But I don't see the master anywhere.
Cliff
	"........."
Mena
	"It's best when they're still warm. You should go get them."
Cliff
	"Y-Yeah..."
I take a bite out of the waffles I brought.
Mena
	"It's good, right?"
Cliff
	"Yeah, it's really good."
The waffles are certainly good.
But... I'm sad that I couldn't meet the master today.
After we finish eating and put the money on the counter, we exit the Cafe.

---

I find Mena at the Cafe Terrace.
...She's letting out a sigh for some reason.
Mena
	"Oh... Cliff."
Cliff
	"...What are you doing?"
Mena
	"...I was looking for a place where I might be able to work, but..."
Cliff
	"Did you find a place?"
Mena
	"I'm sighing because I couldn't find a place."
Cliff
	"Oh, I see."
Mena
	"Did you find us a job as Hunters?"
Cliff
	"No..."
We both let out a deep sigh.

---

Mena
	"Welcome."
Cliff
	"Huh? Mena?"
Mena
	"Yeah. I'll be working here starting today."
Mena
	"How is it? Does the uniform look good on me?"
Cliff
	"Oh, yeah. I think it suits you."
Mena
	"Aha. Thanks."
Mena
	"Hanna-san introduced me to this job. I'm saved since she's been so kind to me."
Cliff
	"I see. That's good."
Mena
	"Yeah. I finally found a job, so I should work hard."
Cliff
	"You're right. Good luck, Mena."
Mena
	"Yeah, you too, Cliff."
