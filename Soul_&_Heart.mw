'''Описание:'''

Once, when the chance showed up, Sirius risked everything to get once into the records room to get one piece of data she wanted, which is the identity of her parents. This ruined her life, as she was caught due to "stealing" of information and dealing physical injuries. She regretted everything she did in that day. But one year after her stay in prison, she had to be transferred to a different section of the prison area.

In there, she met Cetus, a "woman" who got her gender removed, and Daena Blackstar, a young appointed general who started guarding their cells as part of her training on "discipline". Little did she know they will be part on the next turn of events that will change her life...

As time passes by, her life gets worse as memories of long ago started coming to her, as if a lone spirit awaking from a long sleep. With the medium of dreams she was able to look at other people's hearts at the past... and on her own, which brought on the realization of what is behind her own mysterious past. The stories makes the past more tangling, more confusing... It triggers one event that will break each others' trust to everyone.
