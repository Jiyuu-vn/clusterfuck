    nvlx "Okay, I'll get this straight. I don't really want to bore you with my talk just like in S&H, so I won't be having some sort of choice thingie in here."
    nvlx "Firstly, the idea for Twin Faces started back before NaNoRenO even started. I wasn't even thinking about NaNoRenO the time I made this."
    nvlx "All I thought that, while writing Withering Blossoms, Milicent {i}has{/i} to be understood somehow.{w} I mean, duh! Lots of people who played S&H didn't get her."
    nvlx "And the only way for her to be understood is to see things in her view."
    nvlx "It was hard writing for a, well, delusional girl. Notice her sudden change of attitude, sudden change of mind, and well, screw it. I sucked, right?"
    nvl clear
    nvlx "Second, her name, Milicent, doesn't really mean anything important or anything that signifies her attitude. It is more of a personal thing."
    nvlx "If you remember someone named \"mint-and-chocolate\" back at the LemmaSoft forums (if you are a LSF member), well, it's something concerning our friendship, which broke several days after she joined in on the forums because of an issue back at school."
    nvlx "She's also making a VN and she also has a character named Milicent. But I guess making that disgusts her because I am also making one, so my Milicent is some sort of a tribute to our friendship."

    nvlx "Third, Mae means \"before\" in Japanese. It symbolizes her connection with Milice's past and her Musica Syndrome as well."
    nvlx "I really wanted it Japanese because as a Musica Syndrome \"patient\", she knows Japanese culture the best, so I guess I have to connect that."

    nvlx "Fourth, any plot hole in the story is either intentional or a big mistake. Go figure it out."
    nvlx "Well, delusions are confusing as well, so they're almost the same."
