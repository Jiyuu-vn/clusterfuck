Will
	"Allow me to formally welcome you. Welcome to the Hunter Academy."
Will
	"Right now, the students at this Academy are you two, Lucy, and Aoi."
Cliff
	"Um... What are we supposed to do here?"
Will
	"You will basically be training to become better Hunters."
Mena
	"Train... What sort of things will we be doing?"
Will
	"Our motto is that on-site practice is the best training."
Cliff
	"On-site?"
Will
	"To put it simply, I'm saying that actually fighting monsters is the best way to train."
Cliff
	"Um..."
Will
	"I have to add that the Academy has a financial crisis."
Cliff
	"........."
Will
	"So... It'll be very efficient if we can also earn money while we're fighting monsters."
Cliff
	"Um..."
Will
	"...Do you understand what you will be doing now?"
Cliff
	"S-So, I should find a job where fighting monsters is involved...?"
Will
	"I like smart people like you, Cliff-kun."
Cliff
	"U-Um... Doesn't a school like this usually have a sponsor or something?"
Will
	"There is... but we caused that person a lot of trouble already when we got this building."
Will
	"And the other sponsor got into an unfortunate accident the other day and passed away."
Will
	"That person was your father, Murdock."
Cliff
	"Oh........."
Will
	"We will still continue to look for new sponsors, but..."
Will
	"It's not like we'll take anybody that'll pay us."
Will
	"If they ask us for collateral, Hunters might become a private army for that sponsor."
Will
	"We have to be carefull who we choose as our sponsor."
Will
	"In that regard, Murdock was the best sponsor."
Will
	"He was seriously concerned about people becoming victims of monsters..."
Cliff
	"......"
Will
	"Let's get back on track. For all of those reasons, we have to pay for our own needs for a while."
Will
	"So, to be honest... The Academy is in no condition to be selective on our jobs."
Will
	"So we're even taking jobs that don't involve monsters."
Mena
	"...It sounds like utility men."
Will
	"That's exactly what we are. But that is why we are accepted in this city as Hunters."
Will
	"A shady job like a Hunter is hated in other towns."
Will
	"The first thing we did after building this Academy was to make the people approve of us."
Will
	"We had lots of trouble at the start, but the people have accepted us. So you don't need to be worried."
Will
	"I think Lucy and Aoi did a really great job on that."
Mena
	"We have to do our best too. Right, Cliff?"
Cliff
	"Yeah, you're right."
Will
	"Then please give me your best regards."
Will
	"That's not the only problem, though..."
Cliff
	"Another problem? ...What is it?"
Will
	"This Academy is being targeted."
Cliff
	"Targeted!? You mean by monsters?"
Will
	"No, by a human. That's why it's worse than monsters."
Mena
	"But why would someone be after us?"
Will
	"This person is trying to build a large resort here."
Cliff
	"Resort...?"
Will
	"Yeah. This place has hot springs."
Will
	"But we can't just give up our building."
Will
	"No matter how much they may offer us."
Cliff
	"Right...!"
It's not because Will-Sensei told us, but I feel like we can't just give up this building. It's for my dad who put lots of effort into the establishment of this Academy...

Will
	"Well... this is your first time here, right? Let us show you two around town."
Cliff
	"Oh... Please do."
Will
	"All right. Iry. Can you show them around?"
Iry
	"All right, Sensei."
Will
	"Oh, and one more thing."
Iry
	"What, Sensei?"
Will
	"Would you please stop calling me Sensei?"
Iry
	"Come on. I've been calling you like that for a long time now."
Iry
	"Well... Come on, you two."
Cliff
	"Oh... Okay."
