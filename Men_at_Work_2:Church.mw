Aoi
	"...Is there something I can help you with?"
Cliff
	"Um... I'm looking for a work..."
Aoi
	"Thank you for your hard work. Please do your best."
Cliff
	"Uh... okay."
Cliff
	ЃiI can't keep a conversation going with her...Ѓj


Cliff
	"Um... Nice job on the cleaning."
Aoi
	"Thank you. This is my job."
Cliff
	"Oh... yeah, you're right."
Aoi
	"........."
Cliff
	"........."
Aoi
	"Do you want something?"
Cliff
	"Um... no..."

---	
	
Cliff
	"Um... did you happen to hear anything that we might be able to work with?"
Aoi
	"No, nothing in particular."
Cliff
	"Oh... I see."
Aoi
	"........."
Cliff
	"........."
Aoi
	"I thought you had something to do here."
Cliff
	"Oh, sorry."
Aoi
	"...Please make this short."
Cliff
	ЃiI can't even talk to her.Ѓj

---	
	
Aoi
	"Thank you for your hard work, Substitute Academy President."
Cliff
	"Substitute Academy President...?"
Aoi
	"Is there something wrong?"
Cliff
	"Well, I'm not used to being called that... so just call me Cliff."
Aoi
	"Is that so? Than I shall call you so."
Cliff
	"Yeah, please."
Aoi
	"And... do you need something?"
Aoi
	"Oh... Thanks for your hard work."
Cliff
	"You too. How was it? Did you hear anything about incidents with monsters?"
Aoi
	"Nothing in particular."
Cliff
	"I see... I'll look around a bit more, so you keep it up too, Aoi-san."
Aoi
	"Yes... good luck."
	
---
	
Aoi
	"How is your situation?"
Cliff
	"Umm... not too good. How about you?"
Aoi
	"Same here, not too well."
Cliff
	"Well... it can't be helped. Let's keep up the steady effort."
Aoi
	"You're right."
Cliff
	"Do customers come to this shop?"
Aoi
	"Yes, they do. Like right now."
Cliff
	"Well... leaving me aside."
Aoi
	"Well, 'people' do come... but they are not customers."
Aoi
	"Selling medication is only a side job here."
Cliff
	"Oh yeah... this is a church after all."
Aoi
	"What did you think it was until now?"

---
	
Cliff
	"Thank you for your hard work."
Aoi
	"You're welcome... You too, Cliff-san."
Cliff
	"But it sure is hot."
Aoi
	"You're right... then I will spray some water in front of the Academy after work."
Cliff
	"Yeah, please."

---	
	
Aoi
	"Oh... welcome, Cliff-san"
Cliff
	"Um... please don't hate Sheryl too much."
Aoi
	"I am not trying to hate her."
Aoi
	"It's just that... she is a ghost, so I cannot deny that I tense up unconsciously."
Aoi
	"...But I cannot do much about this."
Cliff
	"Hmm..."
Exorcist sure is a troublesome profession...
Aoi
	"Sigh..."
Cliff
	"How is it? Does it seem like Sheryl can be sent to heaven?"
Aoi
	"If it seems possible, I won't be making this face."
Cliff
	"Oh... I see..."
Aoi
	"Geez... my pride as an exorcist is completely shattered."
Cliff
	"That's troubling..."
I can only answer so.
Cliff
	"What kinds of methods have you tried on Sheryl?"
Aoi
	"...Starting with normal purification, I have tried charmed paper, holy water, holy scripture..."
Aoi
	"I have tried everything, even things outside of my religion..."
Cliff
	"But, there's no effect yet?"
Aoi
	"No..."
Cliff
	"Is it possible that Sheryl isn't a ghost? Could she be some kind of a spirit?"
Aoi
	"That is not possible. I can sense her this clearly because she is a human ghost."
Aoi
	"Sheryl-san is definitely a human ghost and not a spirit."
Cliff
	"Hmm..."
I guess there's no mistake if she declares it like that...
Aoi
	"That is why I am irritated I cannot ascend her with my own powers..."
Aoi
	"If I were more... powerful..."
Cliff
	"I think that's negative thinking."
Cliff
	"Let's keep working on it. I'm sure there is a way."
Aoi
	"You're right... I'll try harder."

---	
	
Cliff
	"Hot weather is still continuing, isn't it?"
Aoi
	"If you put your mind to it, you can do anything. You can ignore the heat by training your mind."
Cliff
	"So, you're saying I should train my bluff for the sake of my pride?"
Aoi
	"...I think you're wrong."
Aoi
	"Being hot is fine, but what is troubling is when doesn't rain."
Aoi
	"There are so many dust clouds in front of the gate."
Cliff
	"Yeah... you have to spray water out there often."
Aoi
	"It doesn't do much, though."
Cliff
	"Is there anyone else in the church besides you?"
Aoi
	"There is the Priest."
Cliff
	"...I've never met him."
Aoi
	"He is a busy man, so he is often out of town."
Cliff
	"...How about now?"
Aoi
	"He has gone to the neighboring town. I do not know when he will be back..."
Cliff
	"Do you take care of things by yourself when the Priest is not here?"
Aoi
	"I am entrusted with everything around here when he is gone."
Cliff
	"...That's hard work."
Aoi
	"It can't be helped. There is no one else anyway."
Cliff
	"Is there anything I can help with?"
Aoi
	"Thank you for the offer, but we are not busy right now."
Aoi
	"Please concentrate on your own work."
Cliff
	"Okay, I understand."
	
---	
	
Aoi
	"Oh..."
Aoi-san goes into the back room as soon as she sees me, like she was running away from me...
It can't be helped, so I put the money for the things I bought on the alter and leave the church.
There's nothing else to do here, so I exit the church.

---

Aoi
	"Oh... Cliff-san."
Cliff
	"Oh... a customer?"
Gentleman
	"Hello. Are you a member of this church as well?"
Cliff
	"Oh, no... I'm just here to see Aoi-san..."
Gentleman
	"Oh... Please excuse me then. Did I interrupt a lover's time?"
Aoi
	"T-That's not..."
Cliff
	"U-Um... excuse me, but who are you...?"
Gentleman
	"Oh... my name is Wisor. I have come to this town to study the history."
Cliff
	"History?"
Cliff
	"Huh...? Was it... Wisor-san?"
Wisor
	"Oh... you were the Hunter called..."
Cliff
	"Cliff Winston. Nice to meet you."
Aoi
	"Wisor-san seems to be investigating the history around this area."
Cliff
	"History?"
Wisor
	"Yes. I am looking into the legend of the 'witch' in this town."
Aoi
	"A... witch?"
Wisor
	"Yes. I am mostly looking for information on Irena."
Wisor
	"Do you know the name Irena Mihairoff... the head of one of the Three Great Families, the Mihairroff family?"
Cliff
	"N-No... I haven't even heard of the Three Great Families before."
Aoi
	"The Three Great Families perfected the immortality spell during the great magic age. Mihairoff, Drakul, and Cyphon."
Wisor
	"Exactly. So you know about it."
Aoi
	"But... immortality is an illusion and I cannot possibly believe it."
Wisor
	"The Three Great Families each found a different way to sustain immortality."
Wisor
	"The Cyphon Family turned into Succubus that suck sexual force from people and turn it to their own life..."
Wisor
	"The Drakul Family turned into Vampires that suck people's live blood and turn it to their own life..."
Wisor
	"And... the Mihairoff Family turned into witchs that directly stole other peoples life force..."
Wisor
	"What I am investigating right now is the head of this Mihairoff Family... Irena."
Cliff
	"I see..."
Wisor
	"If I could, I wanted to meet the Priest here and get some details about it..."
Aoi
	"I'm sorry... the Priest is not here at the moment..."
Wisor
	"It's all right. I'll come some other time."
Wisor
	"Oh, yes... I am residing at the Benjamin residence right now."
Cliff
	"Oh, is that so?"
Wisor
	"If you hear any interesting stories, please tell me. I shall be waiting."
Wisor-san gives a quick bow and leaves the church.
Aoi
	"A spell of immortality... what do you think, Cliff-san?"
Cliff
	"In other words, you have to quit being a human to be immortal, right?"
Cliff
	"I don't like... that idea."
Aoi
	"Yes... I feel the same way."

---	
	
Aoi
	"I've been hearing a lot of strange rumors recently."
Cliff
	"Strange rumors?"
Aoi
	"People are seeing monsters more frequently, and seeing monsters they have never seen before."
Aoi
	"It seems like a sign of something ill about to happen..."
Cliff
	"Yeah, you might be right. It might be good to watch out."
I hope it's just overanxiety...

---

Aoi
	"How is the town?"
Cliff
	"Nothing is strange in particular. It doesn't look any different."
Aoi
	"I see... I feel that the evil air is getting stronger recently..."
Cliff
	"It's not just your imagination?"
Aoi
	"It is definitely not just my imagination."
Cliff
	"Do you know the source of that evil air?"
Aoi
	"No, it seems like it is surrounding the whole town..."
...It might be good to really watch out.
Cliff
	"I've looked around the town since then, but I didn't feel anything strange."
Aoi
	"But the evil air is getting stronger by the day..."
Cliff
	"What does that evil air feel like?"
Aoi
	"Don't you feel like it is hard to breath?"
Cliff
	"Hmm... I don't feel it..."
Aoi
	"I see... It probably is something only exorcists feel."
Aoi
	"I feel a hard-to-breath, sticky, stagnant flow of air..."
I don't understand at all...


Aoi
	"Was anything strange happening in town?"
Cliff
	"Hmm... I didn't see anything out of the ordinary happening."
Aoi
	"Please watch out... I have a bad feeling."
Cliff
	"All right. If you find something too, tell me."
Aoi
	"Okay."

---	
	
Aoi
	"Oh... Cliff-san..."
Cliff
	"Aoi-san... You finished your work, right?"
Aoi
	"Yes... I was about to go home."
There is no one in the church, and the sun is setting... creating a lonely atmosphere here... Oh, if it's here, maybe... but...
Hey, do you want to do it here? Let's go home, Aoi-san
Cliff
	"Let's go home. Mena is waiting with dinner ready for us."
Aoi
	"Yes, you're right."

---

Cliff
	"Hey, Aoi-san."
Aoi
	"Yes...?"
Cliff
	"Um... do you want to do it here?"
Aoi
	"Huh...!?"
Cliff
	"I don't think anyone would peek in here..."
Aoi
	"Here...? That is such a sin..."
Cliff
	"God will probably... bless us."
Cliff
	"If I may wish, please let us do it peacefully without anyone peeking."
Aoi
	"Geez, Cliff-san..."
She has that expression of "geez", but in the end, Aoi-san agrees to my idea.

---

Aoi
	"Oh... Cliff-san..."
Aoi-san is waiting for me at the church like always.
Aoi
"Um... today, too...?"
To Aoi-san's expectation, I reply...
—Let's do it today too
—Let's go home today

---

Cliff
	"...Let's just go home for today."
Aoi
	"...Yes."
Cliff
	"Yeah..."
Aoi
	"Geez... you can't be helped..."
But she's smiling, in contrast to her words.

---

Cliff
	"Seems like you've been working late recently."
Aoi
	"Yes... I only have to clean up for today."
Should I go home with her or...
—I'll help you, so let's go home quickly
—Do you want to do it...here?

---

Cliff
	"I'll help you, so let's finish this quickly and go home."
Aoi
	"Oh... Thank you."
Aoi
	"Oh... Cliff-san."
Aoi
	"I am ready to leave any time."
Aoi
	"Please prepare medicine and items too, Cliff-san."
Cliff
	"Yeah, I know."

---	
	
Cliff
	"Sheryl... are you here?"
Aoi
	"Eh...!?"
Cliff
	"Oh... Aoi-san...?"
Someone is there, but it's not Sheryl, but Aoi-san.
Aoi
	"W-Why are you here...?"
Cliff
	"Um... Sheryl told me to come to the church because she wanted to talk."
Aoi
	"Sheryl-san also told me to come here... because she wanted to talk alone..."
Cliff
	"Me too..."
Sheryl-san... what is she planning?
Aoi
	"U-Um... sorry. I'm leaving now..."
...And Aoi-san tries to run away from me again.
Cliff
	"Wait! Aoi-san!"
Aoi
	".........!"
Aoi-san stops at my scream-like call.
Cliff
	"I'm sorry for screaming..."
Cliff
	"No... more than that, I'm sorry..."
Aoi
	"About what...?"
Cliff
	"I've made you feel bad so many times..."
Cliff
	"I'm always careless... undependable, and always causing you problems..."
Aoi
	"T-That's not..."
Cliff
	"I understand clearly it's natural for you to hate meЃc"
Aoi
	"Eh?"
Cliff
	"You get angry and run away every time I see you, so I couldn't apologize."
Cliff
	"So... let me apologize right now. I'm really sorry."
Aoi
	"Cliff-san..."
Cliff
	"...I wanted to at least say that."
It feels like a big lead weight is now hanging from my heart, and I turn my back to Aoi-san.
I want to get out of here quickly.
But then... someone jumps at my back.
Well... there's only Aoi-san here, so it's not someone...
Aoi
	"I'm sorry... I'm the one that should be apologizing..."
Cliff
	"Aoi-san...?"
Aoi
	"I never knew...I... let you feel that way..."
Aoi
	"I'm... really sorry..."
Cliff
	"Aoi-san..."
Aoi-san cries... pushing her face onto my back...
Aoi
	"I didn't hate you... I was just embarrassed..."
Aoi
	"I couldn't get myself to look at you..."
Aoi
	"I... love you, Cliff-san...!"
Cliff
	"Eh...?"
A sudden confession from Aoi-san...
I can't believe it right away...
Cliff
	"I always thought ... I was hated..."
Aoi
	"No... that is not true..."
Aoi-san's arms embrace me harder.
Cliff
	"Really...?"
She nods slightly behind my back.
Cliff
	"It's a bit too hard... Aoi-san."
Aoi
	"Oh..."
Aoi
	"I'm sorry... really..."
Cliff
	"It's all right... wipe your tears away."
...I've never experienced a girl crying for me, so I get a bit nervous...
Cliff
	"Um... honestly, I still can't believe it..."
Cliff
	"Aoi-san... really...?"
Aoi
	"Yes... it's true... these are my honest feelings..."
Aoi
	"I did not know what this feeling inside of me was until now..."
Aoi
	"But now, when I thought you would go away, I couldn't stop myself and..."
Aoi
	"...I finally realized I did not want to lose you..."
Aoi
	"I finally realized my feelings..."
Cliff
	"Me too... To be honest, I was really depressed until just now."
Cliff
	"Because I thought you, the person I didn't want to be hated by, hated me."
Cliff
	"To prove it, I feel much better now."
Aoi
	"Cliff-san...?"
Cliff
	"I think I love you too..."
Aoi
	"Eh..."
Cliff
	"You wouldn't mind, right? If I love you..."
Aoi
	"No..."
I gently embrace Aoi-san in this church lit by the setting sun...
Then... I gently press my lips against hers.
It felt like an eternity has passed in an instant...
Cliff
	"Maybe... Sheryl set us up?"
Aoi
	"Huh?"
Cliff
	"No... it's nothing."
Cliff
	"Let's go home. Everyone's waiting."
Aoi
	"Y-Yes..."

---	
	
Aoi
	"Do you need something?"
Aoi
	"Thank you."
Aoi
	"Please come again."
Looks like no one is in the church.
Aoi
	"Do you need something?"
I don't have anything in particular I want to buy, so I greet her and exit the church.
