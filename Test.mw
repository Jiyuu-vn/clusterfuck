`  How bizarre.@  What was I doing here?@

`  I mean, if memory served, I'd jumped off a cliff but moments ago.@

`  I tried to avoid him, but I didn't quite make it, and a head-on collision !s100-- !s20didn't happen.@

`  In fact, he just kept walking on as if I weren't even there, as if there was nothing in his path...@

`  You don't just expect people to 'slip though' other people like that!@

`  "... Hmm?"
br

`  Hmm, for a moment there, I could have sworn that I'd stepped on something a bit fishy, but I didn't pay it much attention.\

`  I tried to ask of someone standing nearby.\

`  At first it was astonishing, but as you might expect, pretty soon you get used to it.\

br

`  No use crying over spilled milk, after all.@

`  So instead, I started trying different things out, and as a result of this experimentation I found that:\

`  * I couldn't touch anything that had a strong life force in it -- live humans and animals, for instance -- !w300but I could touch things that had little or no life force in them, like inanimate objects.@

`  * I could do stuff like fly in the air.@

`  * I couldn't do stuff like speak to anyone.@

`  * I couldn't eat, obviously, but that was just as well.@

`  * I couldn't go to the bathroom, either, but that was REALLY just as well.@

`  * I could even change my very form, if I really felt like it.\

`  Pretty awesome, eh?  Being able to fly, that is.@

`  Back then, I couldn't save her.@

`  ... And I couldn't save her now, either.\

`  The onlookers are all but gone, and now it's just the two of us.@

`  And so I pull out a vial that I'd hidden away in the folds of my kimono.@

`  Medicine that I'd been planning on testing on my sister someday.@

`  But that isn't possible anymore.@

`  It's a coarse powder, so somewhat tough to take without any water, but I'm past the point of caring.@  I swallow it all down.@

`  Then I touch my lips to my sister's.\

`  And I breathe a little prayer of parting and reunion.@

`  I grip my sister's hands tightly -- so tightly -- so that we will never be separated again.@

`  So that we will be able to meet again.@

`  Chiyu was just staring at this new arrival with utter suspicion.@

`  Well, it wasn't as if she'd remember, after all.@


`  Since she was just one year old at the time.\

`  My mother shifted her interest to Chiyu, and the two of them talked about all sorts of things.@

`  I'd been worried that Chiyu and Mom wouldn't really connect, but this put those groundless fears to rest.\

`  Oooh, so now the fishman was out of the frying pan and into the fire.@

`  He turned to me, his eyes pleading for help, but I ignored him.\

`  My life was just too precious to me.  Though I WAS already dead.@

`  ... My, how polluted the air has become recently.@  It must be because of those newfangled "cars" people are driving these days...@

`  I resorted to making observations like that in order to try to block out Fishman's unearthly screams.@  I failed, by the way.@

`  "Well now, since we're meeting again after such a long time, there are lots of things I want to know about."\

`  Apparently, my mother hadn't changed ONE BIT since the last time I'd seen her.@

`  Talk about scary...@

`  ... *sigh*  I mean, they say that it's nice to be young, but THIS WAS RIDICULOUS.\

`  My mother was now chatting away gaily with Chiyu, her back turned to me.@

`  ...... Hang on a sec.@

`  I asked, pointing at SOMETHING that was growing out of her back.@

`  BEING GIFTED...?!  Was it THAT SIMPLE to just start sprouting stuff like that?!@

`  I wondered as I stared at the jet-black wings that were protruding from my mother's back.\

`  I was sleeping in my usual tomb when,@

`  Fishman suddenly burbled,

`  "Hey!  There's somebody here!"\
br


`  "What, are we being seanced from the grave or something?"@
br

`  And so I went out of the tomb and took a look.@

`  Wow, there really WAS somebody here.\

`  I introduced myself casually, and watched what this person would do.@

`  But fortunately, he seemed rather pleased with me.@
br

`  ... Well, after all, being summoned like this was pretty unusual,@ and I had to make a note to make sure that this kind of thing didn't happen again.@
br

`  Anyway, it was unthinkable at the time that I became a ghost,@ but can you imagine?  We can even surf the internet these days!@

`  After all, there are lots of things in life that you'll never really understand, right?\
